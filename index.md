## Welcome, and happy happy happy birthday!

I remember when you had to cook for yourself one summer, you made a lot of recipes from home, 
so I've put all of Mama's recipes that I copied (as well as some of my own that I've enjoyed 
enough to want to make again) into a website for you. Obviously, you may still come over for meals, 
but since I won't cook for you all the time, I thought you might appreciate this. In light of
your inclination for faster, simpler recipes, I've included an experimental rice cooker
section of one-dish recipes that you can make by mixing everything in the rice cooker then
turning the rice cooker on. I haven't tried any of them. I hear the  dining commons food 
gets boring after a while.

You should now be a collaborator of the website, so feel free to fix typos or add recipes 
that you like and would recommend making! Feel free to also take down the experimental rice
cooker recipes if you don't like them :P

Happy birthday and prijatno!

## Addendum

If you feel like eating a particular cuisine, I've added a cuisine tag to each recipe page,
so just type the cuisine in the search bar, and you will see the list of recipes corresponding to
that cuisine.

Valid cuisine searches are listed below (please update this list if you add any). Each dish is tagged
with a broad indication of the cuisine (the first level of bullet points) and a more specific location
if appropriate.
