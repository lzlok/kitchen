## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 c. milk</li>
	<li>2 eggs</li>
	<li>2 tbs. sugar</li>
	<li>2 tbs. flour</li>

</ul>

## Instructions
In a small pot, mix sugar and flour together. Slowly add the milk, stirring until sugar and flour are dissolved. Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until starting to thicken. 

Whisk eggs together in a small bowl. Slowly add about 2 tbs. of the warm milk mixture into the eggs, stirring as you do so. Pour the eggs into the milk pot. Using a wooden spoon, mix well to blend the eggs in. After a minute or so of stirring, add the corn. Mix well. Adjust salt and pepper. Stir for another 2-3 minutes over low heat. 

Pour into oven-proof dish and bake 30-40 minutes at 350 F.

One recipe makes about 3 cups of corn pudding (before baking).
