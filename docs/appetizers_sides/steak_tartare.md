In a pan, fry the capers. Once done, reserve half to keep whole for garnish. Chop the other half and set aside to be mixed in to the beef.

Mash garlic and anchovy toether in a mortar and pestle. In a bowl, whisk together egg yolk, lemon juice, and mustard. Add anchovy oil and olive oil.

Mix together with chopped meat.

Serve garnished with confit egg yolk, whole capers, and parsley. Serve bread on the side.
