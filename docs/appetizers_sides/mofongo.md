## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 c. oil for frying</li>
	<li>5 unripe plantains, cut into ¾” pieces</li>
	<li>1 lb. pork cracklings, cut into 1” pieces</li>
	<li>2 tbs. garlic, mashed</li>
	<li>1½ tsp. salt</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Fry plantains in oil until golden brown all over. Using too little oil will increase the cooking time and cause them to dry out. Mash the garlic, salt, plantains, and cracklings together. To shape, pack into small bowls them turn the bowl over to release the mofongo onto the plate.
