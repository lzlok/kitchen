#### From Julia Child

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>3 large firm ripe tomatoes</li>
	<li>Salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
	<li>1 to 1Â½ c. fresh breadcrumbs</li>
	<li>2 tbs minced shallots</li>
	<li>1 tsp dried herbes de Provence</li>
	<li>3 Tbs freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
	<li>2 to 3 Tbs chopped parsley</li>
	<li>3 to 4 Tbs olive oil</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Set a rack on the upper-middle level and preheat the oven to 400 F.

Core the tomatoes and cut them in half crosswise. Over a
plate or bowl, squeeze each half gently to force out the seeds and juice
(reserve for stock). With your fingers, clean the cavities of any clinging
seeds. Arrange in the baking dish cut side up. If any halves are wobbly or
tilted, trim a bit off the bottom so that they sit flat in the pan. Season with
a sprinkling of salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.

Stir together the bread crumbs, shallots, dried herbs,
grated cheese, and chopped parsley in a small bowl. Add 2 or 3 tbs. of the
olive oil, tossing well to moisten the crumbs evenly.
