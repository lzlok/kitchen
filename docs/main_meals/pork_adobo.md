#### Cuisine: Asian, Filipino

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>½ kg pork shoulder, cut into 2” x 1.5” pieces (note: can be made with chicken instead)</li>
	<li>½ head garlic, pounded</li>
	<li>2 tsp. salt</li>
	<li>1 tsp. soy sauce (for color)</li>
	<li>½ tsp. black pepper, ground</li>
	<li>1 tbs. lard</li>
	<li>1 c. water</li>
	<li>½ c. coconut vinegar</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Sauté pork with vinegar, garlic, pepper, salt, and water in a saucepan. Cover the saucepan and cook slowly until most of the broth has evaporated and only ¼ c. remains. Skim off a couple of tablespoons of fat that has risen to the top.

Drain, separate the pieces of garlic from the pork, and fry in lard (or the skimmed fat that was saved), and fry until brown. Add the pieces of pork and fry until brown. Add the broth and let simmer for about 5 minutes. Serve hot.

### Note
Achwete or annatto can also be added. Warm ⅓ c. water (part of the 1 c. needed in the recipe) and use it to soak 2 tbs. annatto seeds. Crush the seeds with your hands to loosen the color. Drain. Add another ⅓ c. water and repeat until all of the 1 c. water is used. Omit the soy sauce.
