	<li>4 tbs. olive oil</li>
	<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
	<li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
	<li>1 medium tomato, chopped</li>
	<li>1 tbs. minced parsley</li>
	<li>2 pimientos, homemade or imported, cut in strips</li>
	<li>2 c. short-grain rice</li>
	<li>4 c. fish broth or clam juice (homemade is MILES better)</li>
	<li>½ c. peas, fresh or frozen</li>
	<li>½ tsp. paprika</li>
	<li>½ dried red chili pepper, seeds removed, crumbled</li>
	<li>Few strands saffron</li>
	<li>1 medium potato, peeled and cut in very thin slices (about 1/16 inch)</li>
</ul>

### Garlic Sauce


<ul>
	<li>3 cloves garlic</li>
	<li>½ c. olive oil</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Soak the cod 36 hours in water to cover, changing the water several times. Drain the cod and chop. Heat the oil in a shallow 12” casserole, preferably earthenware. Sauté the garlic and onion until the onion is wilted. Add the tomato and parsley and cook 5 minutes. Stir in the pimiento and cod and cook 5 minutes more. Add the rice, stirring to coat well. (The dish may be prepared in advance up to this point.) Pour in the broth and add the peas. Season with salt, paprika, chili pepper, and saffron. Cook, uncovered, over a medium flame for 10 minutes, stirring, until the rice is no longer soupy but some liquid remains.

Arrange the potato slices over the casserole. Place in a 325˚F oven for 15 minutes, until the liquid is absorbed but the rice is not yet done. Place under the broiler briefly to brown the potatoes. Let sit, lightly covered with foil, for about 10 minutes more.

While the rice is resting, place the crushed garlic in a processor or blender. Very gradually, with the motor running, pour in the oil (you may also do this with a mortar and pestle). Pass this garlic sauce separately. Serve the ice with Tomato and Egg Salad and a dry white wine like Campo Viejo.
