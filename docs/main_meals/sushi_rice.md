## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>150g sushi rice</li>
	<li>230ml water</li>
	<li>2 tbs. rice vinegar</li>
	<li>1 tbs. sugar</li>
	<li>1â…• tsp. salt</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Rinse the rice then soak in cold water for 30-60 minutes to ensure the rice cooks evenly and the grains don't split. Cook the ice.

To make the marinade, heat the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a sauce pan just until the sugar and salt have dissolved.
Leave to cool. To mix into the rice, set up a fan to blow over the rice. If using a wooden spoon, wet the spoon before slowly pouring the mixture into the rice and incorporating thoroughly.

For sashimi, weight 20g portions of rice and shape.

Makes 18 pieces of sashimi.
