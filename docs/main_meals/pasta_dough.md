## Ingredients

### For 3 or 4 persons
<ul>
	<li>2 eggs</li>
	<li>1½ c. all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>

### For 5 or 6 persons
<ul>
	<li>3 eggs</li>
	<li>2¼ c. all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>

### For 7 or 8 persons
<ul>
	<li>4 eggs</li>
	<li>3 c. all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
In general, with American flour and large eggs, it is best to approximate ¾ c. of flour for every egg. 
It is easier for beginners to work with less than with more flour, because the dough stays softer and easier to handle. If you keep it too soft, however, 
it may also become a problem, because very soft dough is likely to stick and tear.
