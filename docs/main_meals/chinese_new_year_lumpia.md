## Instructions

### Filling
Heat oil in a wok or frying pan until shimmering. Add a small amount of beaten egg and swirl around to make a thin layer. When egg is firm, flip it and cook the other side. Remove from pan and set aside. Repeat until all the egg has been cooked. Slice the egg pile into thin strips and put into the mixing pot. It’s best to cook the egg first because the pan will start to get stuff stuck on the bottom as you cook the other ingredients. 
Divide shallots into 6 portions. Cook the different ingredients in the order below, frying each with oil, shallots, salt, and pepper until cooked, then adding it to a large mixing pot:
<ul>
	<li>Pork strips</li>
	<li>Shrimp</li>
	<li>Cabbage, until just wilted</li>
	<li>Carrots. Add a tbs. of water if the heat is not high enough to cook the carrots quickly.</li>
	<li>Bamboo shoots. Fry until shallots are cooked.</li>
	<li>Tofu slices. Fry until shallots are translucent.</li>
</ul>
Heat oil in pan. Add the green beans (no shallots) and season with salt. Fry for a minute and then add 2 tbs. of water and cover. More water might be needed to cook the beans; add a tablespoon or two at a time. Drain any water that is left before adding beans to mixing pot.

### Sauce
Mix all in a pot and cook over medium heat until thickened, stirring occasionally and more frequently as it thickens.

### Seaweed-Bihon Mixture
To make the seaweed-bihon mixture. Deep fry the bihon until puffed then crumble into small pieces and set aside. Sauté hoti in oil for about a minute. Remove from heat and mix in the crumbled bihon.
