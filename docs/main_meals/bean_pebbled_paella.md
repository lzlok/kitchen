## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>⅔ c. each canned chickpeas, pinto beans, red beans, and black beans (reserve all can liquid except from black beans)</li>
	<li>~4½ c. chicken broth</li>
	<li>¼ tsp. crumbled thread saffron</li>
	<li>8 tbs. olive oil</li>
	<li>2 bunches scallions (~½ lb.), finely chopped</li>
	<li>12 garlic cloves, minced</li>
	<li>2 red bell peppers, finely chopped</li>
	<li>3 c. Swiss chard leaves, chopped</li>
	<li>6 tbs. (~6 oz) diced Spanish serrano or prosciutto cured ham cut from a ¼” thick slice</li>
	<li>1 medium tomato, finely chopped</li>
	<li>2 tbs. minced parsley</li>
	<li>2 tsp. sweet smoked paprika (Spanish)</li>
	<li>1 tsp. ground cumin</li>
	<li>3 c. imported Spanish or Arborio short-grain rice</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 400˚F for a gas oven or 450˚F for electric.

Drain the beans and reserve the liquid from all the cans except the black beans. Rinse beans. Combine bean liquid in a pot with enough broth to make 6 cups. Add saffron and keep hot over the lowest heat.

Heat oil in a paella pan measuring 17-18” at its widest point (or in a shallow casserole dish of a similar size). Sauté scallions, garlic, red peppers, Swiss chard, and ham over medium heat until bell peppers are slightly softened. Add tomato and parsley. Cook 1 – 2 minutes then add paprika and cumin.

Stir in the rice and coat well with the pan mixture. Pour in the hot broth and bring to a boil. Add beans, taste for salt, and boil, stirring and rotating pan occasionally, until the rice is no longer soupy but sufficient liquid remains to continue cooking the rice (5 minutes).

Bake uncovered 15 – 20 minutes until rice is almost al dente. Cover and let sit 5 – 10 minutes until rice is cooked to taste.
