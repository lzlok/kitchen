In a bowl, combine all the ingredients for the marinade and mix well. Marinate the prawns for 30 minutes. Dredge marinated prawns in cornstarch and deep fry over high heat until golden brown; do not overcook. Set aside.

Heat 2 tbs. oil in the same pan and sauté the curry leaves, garlic, and chilies until fragrant. Turn off heat. Add butter and salted egg yolks. Mash egg yolks, turn heat back on, and cook until mixture appears foamy.

Return prawns to pan and add a few tablespoons of water if the sauce becomes too dry. Stir in sugar and add salt to taste. Serve immediately and enjoy!
