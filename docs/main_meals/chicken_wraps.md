## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
	<li>2 skinless whole chicken legs (~ 1 lb.)</li>
	<li>2 tbs. unsalted butter</li>
	<li>One 14 – 16 oz. can, whole tomatoes</li>
	<li>½ c. water</li>
	<li>¼ – ½ tsp. cayenne</li>
	<li>1 tsp cumin</li>
	<li>¾ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>1 English cucumber</li>
	<li>~2 tbs. fresh lime juice</li>
	<li>1 firm, ripe avocado</li>
	<li>Four 12” flour tortillas</li>
	<li>2 c. fresh cilantro</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
In a large 2-quart heavy saucepan, cook onion and chicken legs in butter over moderate heat (5 minutes). Drain tomatoes and measure 1 c. packed, reserving remainder for another use. Add tomatoes, water, cayenne, and cumin to chicken and simmer, covered (1 h). Working over pan, pull meat off bones, leaving meat in pan and discarding bones. Simmer, uncovered, until most liquid is evaporated (20 minutes). Stir in salt and cool chicken. This may be made 1 day in advance.

Halve cucumber length-wise and cross-wise and seed. Cut pieces length-wise into very thin strips. In a bowl, toss cucumber with 1 tbs. lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Halve, peel, and pit avocado. Cut avocado into ¼” slices and toss with remaining lime juice. Season with salt and pepper.

Cut 1” off 1 edge of each tortilla. Arrange 1 tortilla with cut edge farthest from you and smear a small piece of avocado length-wise along cut edge. (This will help hold the wrap together.) Spread ¼ of the chicken mixture along the lower fourth of the tortilla ~1” from the bottom. Top chicken with ½ c. cilantro sprigs. Top cilantro with 4 – 5 avocado slices then about ¼ of the cucumber. Tightly roll tortilla from the bottom. Can be made up to 6h ahead and chilled. Cut into inch-thick diagonal slices.

Makes ~32 hors d’oeuvres.
