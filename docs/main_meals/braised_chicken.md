# Braised Chicken with Garlic and Thyme
{: .no_toc }
---

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>Two 3Â½ lb. whole chickens, each cut into 8 pieces</li>
	<li>5 whole heads of garlic, cloves separated, unpeeled</li>
	<li>6 tbs. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
	<li>2 c. dry white wine</li>
	<li>6 very large fresh thyme sprigs</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Trim the chicken. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Lightly smash garlic cloves to flatten slightly, leaving peel attached and cloves as whole as possible.

Heat 4 tbs. oil in a large pot over medium high heat. Working in 2 batches, add chicken and cook until brown on all sides (12 minutes). Transfer to plate. Add remaining 2 tbs oil and garlic to pot. Stir until golden brown (4 min.) Add wine and thyme. Bring to boil. Return chicken to pot. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, moving chicken pieces from top to bottom every 5 minutes (sauce will not cover chicken) about 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

Serve chicken with garlic and sauce.

Serves 8.
