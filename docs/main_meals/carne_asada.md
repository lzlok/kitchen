## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>
	<li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
	<li>¼ cup reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
	<li>Juice of 1 orange</li>
	<li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
	<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
	<li>1 jalapeno, seeded and diced</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
	<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
	<li>1½ pounds flank steak</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
In a medium bowl, combine cilantro, olive oil, soy sauce, orange juice, lime juice, garlic, jalapeno, cumin and 1 teaspoon pepper; set aside ½ cup of the mixture in the refrigerator until ready to serve.

In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine steak and remaining cilantro mixture; marinate for at least 4 hours to overnight, turning the bag occasionally. Drain the steak from the marinade.

Preheat grill to medium high heat. Using paper towels, pat both sides of the steak dry; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Add steak to grill, and cook, flipping once, until desired doneness, about 6 minutes per side for medium rare. Let rest 5 minutes.

Thinly slice steak against the grain and serve with reserved ½ cup cilantro mixture.

Serves 6.
