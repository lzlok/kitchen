#### Baba's Recipe

---

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>Phyllo, 1 box, about a pound</li>
	<li>1.5 lb. ground beef</li>
	<li>1 medium onion, finely diced (about ½ lb)</li>
	<li>1 large Potato, grated (about ½ lb)</li>
	<li>Salt & Pepper</li>
	<li>Oil</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

Squeeze the grated potato to remove any liquid. Mix ground beef, diced onions, grated potato, salt, and pepper. The amount of potato should be about a third of the ground beef. 

Lay out two sheets of phyllo and brush some oil on top; do not soak with oil. Repeat for a total of 3-4 sheets. 

Crumble some of the beef mixture over the whole sheet. It’s okay to have spaces between the lumps of ground beef. 

Lay another 3 sheets of phyllo, every other brushed with oil. Crumble more ground beef mixture over the sheets. 

Roll the sheets of phyllo into a log and snake in a baking pan. Bake in a preheated 350 F for about 40-50 minutes. The phyllo should be golden brown. 

Serve with kefir or yogurt.
