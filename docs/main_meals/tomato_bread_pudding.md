## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>4 eggs</li>
	<li>6 slices of bread</li>
	<li>1 can of pomi tomatoes</li>
	<li>Garlic, minced</li>
	<li>Paprika</li>
	<li>Coriander</li>
	<li>Cilantro</li>
	<li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Preheat an oven to 400˚F. Bring a pot of water to boil for poaching eggs.

In an oven-proof pan, on low heat fry garlic in olive oil until golden. Add paprika and coriander in equal amounts. Fry until fragrant. Add tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Add half a can’s worth of water by sloshing the water in the can then pouring it into the tomatoes.  Bring to simmer.

Meanwhile, slice the crust off of the bread. Cube the bread crusts. Once the tomatoes have simmered for a couple of minutes, add the crusts in.

After the crusts have softened, layer the slices of bread under the mixture and bake for 10-15 minutes. Use this time to poach the eggs.

Serve garnished generously with cilantro.

Serves 2.
