	<li>2 c. water or chicken stock</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
In a deep skillet, heat ghee, add all the spice and stir for 2 minutes or until fragrant. Add garlic and stir for 20 seconds then add diced onion and stir for 3 more minutes. Add chicken pieces and cook for about 3 minutes, tuning to the other side halfway through. Add rice, tomato paste and salt then stir everything well to distribute tomato paste evenly. Pour water and bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and continue to cook on low for 30 minutes or until water is absorbed.

Turn heat off, uncover and let it set for a couple of minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve.

Serves 4.
