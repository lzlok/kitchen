## Instructions
Combine in a large bowl the zucchini, spinach, sweet, and hot red peppers, artichokes, lima beans, mushrooms, peas, and scallions. Combine the broth and saffron in a pot and keep hot over the lowest heat.

Preheat the oven to 400˚F for gas oven, 450˚F for electric.

Heat the oil in a paella pan, measuring 27 – 28” at its widest point (or in a shallow casserole dish of a similar size), over 2 burners if necessary. Add the vegetables from the bowl and sauté about 3 minutes over high heat, until vegetables are slightly softened. Stir in the tomato, garlic, paprika, cumin, and parsley, and cook 2 minutes more. Add rice and coat well with the pan mixture.

Pour in all the hot broth and bring to a boil. Taste for salt and continue to boil about 5 minutes, stirring and rotating the pan occasionally, until the rice is no longer soupy but sufficient liquid remains to cook the rice. Stir in snap peas and transfer to oven. Cook uncovered 10 – 12 minutes in a gas oven, 15 – 12 minutes electric, until the rice is almost al dente. Remove to a warm spot, cover with foil, and let wit 5 – 10 minutes, until the rice is cooked to taste. Serve with garlic sauce.

Serves 8.
