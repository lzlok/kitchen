## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>8 oz. flat rice noodles</li>
    <li>3 tbs. oil</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>8 oz. uncooked shrimp, chicken, or extra-firm tofu, cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1 c. fresh bean sprouts</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
    <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
    <li>½ c. dry roasted peanuts</li>
    <li>2 limes</li>
    <li>½ c. Fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
</ul>

### Sauce
<ul>
	<li>3 tbs. fish sauce</li>
    <li>1 tbs. low-sodium soy sauce</li>
    <li>5 tbs. light brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbs. rice vinegar or Tamarind Paste*</li>
    <li>1 tbs. Sriracha hot sauce, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 tbs. creamy peanut butter</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

Cook noodles according to package instructions, just until tender.  Rinse under cold water.

Combine sauce ingredients in a bowl and set aside.

### Stir Fry
Heat 1½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, onion, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.

Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.

Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.

Garnish the top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!

Serves 4.
