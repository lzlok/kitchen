## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2.5 lb. lab stew (preferably shoulder)</li>
	<lil>3 tbs. olive oil</li>
	<li>1 large onion</li>
	<li>1 red papper</li>
	<li>3 cloves garlic</li>
	<li>A sprig or two of fresh thyme</li>
	<li>1 tbs. good quality mild smoken Hungarian or Spanish paprika</li>
	<li>One 28 oz. can plum tomatoes, drained and chopped</li>
	<li>Â½ c. white wine</li>
	<li>2 c. lamb or chicken stock</li>
	<li>1 tbs. sherry vinegar</li>
	<li>Two 19 oz cans white kidney beans</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

Pre-heat your oven to 325F.

Heat the oil in a dutch oven large enough to hold all the ingredients. Season the lamb generously with salt and pepper. Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan, brown the lamb just until golden. Remove the lamb from the pot and spoon off all but about 2 Tbsp of fat.

Add the onions and red peppers and cook until the onions are soft and translucent, about 4-5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, paprika and about a tsp of salt. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring every few seconds. Add the tomatoes, stock, white wine and vinegar. Return the lamb and any accumulated juices to the pot and bring to a simmer.

Cover and place in the pre-heated oven. Cook for about 75 minutes.

Add the white kidney beans and return to the oven. Cover and cook another 30 minutes.

After 30 minutes, check the lamb. If it isn't yet tender, cook another 15-20 minutes.

Remove from oven and add broth if needed. Salt to taste.

Serve with crusty bread or nothing at all.
