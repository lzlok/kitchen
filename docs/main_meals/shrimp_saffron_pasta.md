## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>Shrimp</li>
	<li>Pasta</li>
	<li>1 tsp saffron</li>
	<li>¼ c. boiling water</li>
	<li>½ tbs olive oil</li>
	<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
	<li>½ c. white wine</li>
	<li>40g butter, cubed</li>
	<li>⅔ c. cream</li>
	<li>1 -- 2 tsp. lemon juice</li>
	<li>1 tsp saffron</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Put the saffron in a small ramekin and pour 1/4 c. of boiling water over it. Let it steep while you cook the pasta and start the sauce.

Cook the pasta, reserving pasta water in case the saffron sauce thickens too much or sticks to the pan.

In a skillet that will fit all the pasta in the end, heat olive oil. Fry the garlic for a minute or two, being careful not to brown it. Lower the heat slightly, add the wine, and simmer until reduced by half (1 -- 2 minutes).

Add the butter in three separate lots, whisking well in between so it becomes a nicely emulsified sauce. Add the saffron and steeping liquid and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the cream and bring to a very gentle simmer. Add the lemon juice and stir quickly. Let the sauce gently bubble for a couple of minutes to thicken slightly.

Add a splash of pasta water if the sauce becomes too thick. Add the pasta and shrimp and serve immediately.

Serves 2.

## Notes:
<ul>
	<li>Be sure to whisk constantly when adding the butter, otherwise it won't emulsify</li>
	<li>Never let the cream get to a boil -- it will separate or curdle</li>
</ul>
