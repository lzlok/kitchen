## Ingredients
### Herb Butter
<ul>
	<li>1 c. butter, softened</li>
	<li>2 tbs. chopped parsley</li>
	<li>1½ tsp. dried tarragon leaves</li>
	<li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
	<li>¾ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>⅛ tsp. pepper</li>
</ul>

### Chicken and Coating


<ul>
	<li>6 boned whole chicken breasts (each ¾ lb.)</li>
	<li>¾ c. flour</li>
	<li>3 eggs well beaten</li>
	<li>1½ c. breadcrumbs</li>
	<li>salad oil/shortening for deep frying</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
In a small bowl, with a rubber scraper, thoroughly mix butter, parsley, tarragon, garlic, salt, and pepper. On a sheet of foil, shape into a 6” square. Freeze until firm (about 40 min.).

Meanwhile, wash the chicken pieces and dry well on paper towel. Using a small, sharp knife, carefully remove skin. Cut each breast in half.

To flatten chicken, place each half, smooth side down, on sheet of waxed paper and cover with another sheet of waxed paper. Using a mallet or side of saucer, pound chicken to about ¼” thick, being careful not to break the meat.

Cut frozen butter into 12 parts. Place a part of the herb butter incenter of each piece of chicken. Bring the long sides of the chicken over the butter and fold ends over, making sure that no butter is showing. Fasten each piece with toothpicks. This is very important to keep the herb butter inside during frying.

Roll each chicken piece in ___ flour on a sheet of waxed paper. Dip each in beaten egg and roll in crumbs, coating evenly. Shape each piece, using hands, into triangles. Refrigerate, covered, until chilled for about 1 hour.

In a Dutch oven or a large, _____ saucepan, slowly heat salad oil or shortening (3 inches deep) to 369˚F in a deep-frying thermometer. Add chicken pieces, 3 at a time. Fry, tuning with tongs until browned — 5 minutes. Drain. (Do not pierce? coating.) Keep warm in 200˚F oven (no more than 5 minutes) in a large frying pan with paper towel.

Makes 8 servings.
