## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>4 small acorn squash (1 to 1¼ lb. each)</li>
	<li>2 tbs. unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces</li>
	<li>½ lb. ground pork</li>
	<li>1 tbs. olive oil + more</li>
	<li>¼ c. chopped onion</li>
	<li>¼ c. chopped celery</li>
	<li>¼ c. chopped carrots</li>
	<li>½ c. white wine</li>
	<li>1½ c. cooked rice</li>
	<li>One 10-oz package frozen spinach, thawed, drained, and chopped</li>
	<li>1½ tsp. dried oregano</li>
	<li>1 recipe of <a href ="sauces/bechamel">béchamel sauce</a></li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Cut squash in half lengthwise. Remove seeds. Rub with extra oil, salt, and pepper. Bake face down on a baking sheet at 400˚F for about 30 minutes.

In a large sauté pan over medium heat, brown ground pork with salt and pepper until no longer pink. Remove meat from pan. Add olive oil and sauté onion, celery, and carrot until they begin to soften (7 – 10 minutes). Deglaze pan with the white wine.

Return pork to pan along with the cooked rice, spinach, pine nuts, oregano, salt, and pepper. Heat mixture thoroughly, about 2 – 3 minutes.

Turning squash halves face up on baking sheet, put a piece of butter in the bowl of each squash. Fill with meat mixture. Bake at 375˚F for about 15 – 20 minutes, then pour béchamel sauce on top of each squash and bake at 450˚F until sauce is nicely browned.
