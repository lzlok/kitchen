## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
	<li>1 large onion, diced</li>
	<li>½ c. breadcrumbs</li>
	<li>1 tbs. flour</li>
	<li>2garlic cloves, minced</li>
	<li>26 oz strained tomatoes</li>
	<li>1 bay leaf</li>
	<li>Oil</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>Pepper</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Combine beef, onions, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper. Form into balls.

Heat some oil in a large pot. Add flour and sauté slightly. Add a few tablespoons of water and stir to make a slurry. Add a bit more water to make it more liquidish. Add garlic, bay leaf, strained tomatoes, salt, pepper, and bring to a boil. Drop meatballs and cook over low heat (so bottom won’t burn) — about 30 – 40 minutes.
