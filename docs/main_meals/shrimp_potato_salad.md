## Instructions
Char peppers over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Wrap in paper bag and leg stand 10 minutes to steam. Peel and seed. Reserve half of red bell pepper for dressing. Cut remaining peppers lengthwise into eighths. (Can be made 4h ahead.)

Cook potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water (~30 minutes). Drain and transfer to large bowl. Pour 6 tbs. wine over potatoes. Add onion, parsley, and ⅔ of dressing and toss well. Cover and let stand for 2 hours.

Combine ¾ c. wine and mussels in a heavy large pot over medium-high heat. Cover and steam 5 minutes. Remove open mussels. Cook remaining mussels about 5 more minutes. Discard closed and half shells. Transfer good mussels to bowl and cool to lukewarm.

Heat 2 tbs. oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Pat shrimp dry and add to skillet. Sprinkle with garlic, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook until just pink (2 – 3 minutes). Transfer to bowl and cool slightly.

Line large platter with curly endive and arugula. Mound potatoes in center. Arrange red and yellow pepper slices round potatoes. Garnish with mussels on the half shell, shrimp, and olives. Drizzle additional dressing on top.

Makes 6 servings.
