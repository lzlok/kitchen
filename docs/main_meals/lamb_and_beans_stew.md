	<li>Lamb, the quantity that would fit in a quarter ziplock, cut into small cubes</li>
	<li>Flour</li>
	<li>1 c. dry cannellini beans</li>
	<li>1 generous handful of cherry tomatoes</li>
	<li>1 red or orange bell pepper</li>
	<li>1 small to medium onion, diced</li>
	<li>3 large cloves of garlic, minced</li>
	<li>Beef broth</li>
	<li>1/2 c. red wine</li>
	<li>Dash of vinegar (preferably apple cider but can also mix balsamic and white vinegar)</li>
	<li>Paprika, roughly 2-3 tsp.</li>
	<li>Crushed red pepper flakes</li>
	<li>Thyme</li>
	<li>Rosemary</li>
	<li>2 bay leaves</li>
	<li>Peppercorns</li>
	<li>Parsley for garnish</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

Soak the beans for 16 hours in the refrigerator. For tender beans that are almost falling apart in the finished stew, 
cook in an instant pot for 25 minutes in ample water. Once done, leave as much water in the pot as possible 
but not so much that adding all the stew ingredients will cause the pot to overflow.

Roast bell pepper in oven until skin is bubbling. Once done, remove skin and cut into small pieces.

Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium low heat. Roast garlic until golden. Remove garlic from pan, leaving as much oil as possible in the pan.

Toss the cubed lamb in flour with salt until barely coated then fry on high heat until browned, stirring occasionally. 
Work in batches as necessary. Remove the lamb.

Brown the onions in the same pan. When they start to caramelize, add the cherry tomatoes and salt. 
Stir for a minute or two until tomatoes start to wilt then pour in the wine to deglaze the pan. Let simmer until wine is slightly reduced.

Add the lamb and tomato-onion mixture to the instant pot. If the beans were just cooked in the instant pot, leave them and their water in. Mix in beef bouillon.
Otherwise, add the beans and broth. Add all the herbs and spices, using enough that their flavor will come through but not so much that they are overpowering.
Once everything is added, add vinegar to taste, navigating by smell. The quantity will depend on the sweetness of the tomatoes but should be about 1 tbs. Cook on high pressure for 30 minutes (if lamb is cut in small cubes, add more time for larger pieces of lamb).

As soon as stew has finished cooking mix in the roasted garlic and bell pepper. Serve garnished with parsley.
