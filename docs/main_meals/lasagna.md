## Instructions

### Ragu
An earthenware pot should be your first choice for making ragu, otherwise use a heavy, enameled cast iron casserole.

Put in the chopped onion, with all the oil and butter, and saute briefly over medium heat until just translucent. 
Add the ground beef, crumbling it in the pot with a fork. Add 1 tsp. salt, stir, and cook only until the meat has lost its raw red color. 
Add the wine, turn the heat up to medium high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the wine has evaporated.

Turn the heat down to medium, add the milk and nutmeg, and cook until the milk has evaporated. Stir frequently.

When the milk has evaporated, add the tomatoes and stir thoroughly. When the tomatoes have started to bubble, turn the heat down 
until the sauce cooks at the laziest simmer, just an occasional bubble. Cook, uncovered, for a minimum of 3.5 to 4 hours, stirring occasionally. Add salt as needed.

### Bechamel Sauce
In a small pan, heat the milk until it comes to the very edge of a boil. While you are heating the milk, melt the butter over low heat in a heavy enameled iron saucepan of 4 to 6 cups' capacity.
When the butter is melted, add all the flour, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Let the flour and butter bubble for 2 minutes,
without ceasing to stir. Do not let the flour become colored.
 
Turn off the heat and add the hot milk 2 tbs. at a time, stirring it constantly into the flour and butter mixture so that it does not clump. As soon as the 2 tbs. has been
incorporated, add the next 2 tbs., repeating until you have added ½ c. to the mixture. At this point, you can start adding ¼ c. at a time until you have added it all.
(Never add more than ¼ c. at a time.)

When all the milk has been incorporated, turn on the heat to low, add the salt, and stir-cook until the sauce is as dense as thick cream.


### Assembly
Once the meat sauce and bechamel are made, make the pasta. Cut the dough into rectangular strips about 4 ½ inches wide and 11 inches long. Do not allow it to dry any longer than it takes
to bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. While the water is coming to a boil, lay some clean, dry towels flat on the work counter and set a bowl of 
cold water near you at the range. When the water boils, add the salt, then drop in 4 of the pasta strips. Stir with a wooden spoon.
Cook for just 10 seconds after the water returns to a boil, then retrieve the pasta with a large slotted spoon, dip it in the bowl,
and rinse it with cold water. Wring each strip very gently by hand and lay it flat on the towel. Cook all the pasta and the trimmings this way. Pat dry on top with another towel.

Preheat the oven to 450F.

Smear the bottom of a 14" lasagne pan with a little bit of meat sauce. Place a single layer of pasta in the pan, overlapping the strips if necessary (but with no more than ¼ inch overlap). 
Do not prop up the edges of the pasta along the sides of the pan. It will become dry and tough there.)
Spread enough sauce on the pasta to dot it with meat then spread bechamel over the meat sauce. Sprinkle cheese (if the bechamel and meat sauce are already salty, use less cheese). 
Add another layer of pasta and coat it as before. Do not make more than 6 thin layers of pasta at the maximum since the lasagna shouldn't be too thick, and do not build up the layers any higher than ½ inch from the top of the pan. 
Use the trimmings to plug up any gaps in the layers. Coat the top layer with bechamel, sprinkle with cheese, and dot lightly with butter.

Bake on the uppermost rack of the oven for 10-15 minutes, until a light, golden crust forms on top. Do not bake for more than 15 minutes. If after 10 minutes' baking you see that no crust is beginning to form, raise the oven temperature for the next 5 minutes.

Allow the lasagna to settle 5-8 minutes before serving. Serve directly from the pan.


## Notes
Bechamel Sauce: When the sauce cools, it sets and you will not be able to spread it. If you must make it in advance, reheat it slowly, stirring constantly until it is the right consistency again. Bechamel sauce can also be refrigerated.

Ragu:
<ol>
	<li>The meat must be sauteed just barely long enough to lose its raw color. It must not brown or it will lose delicacy.</li>
	<li>It must be cooked in milk before the tomatoes are added. This keeps the meat creamier and sweeter tasting.</li>
	<li>It must cook at the merest simmer for a long, long time. the minimum is 3.5 hours, 5 is better.</li>
</ol>
