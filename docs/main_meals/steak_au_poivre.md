---

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>4 tbs. (½ stick) unsalted, cut into 4 pieces</li>
	<li>1 medium shallot, minced</li>
	<li>1 c. beef broth</li>
	<li>¾ c. chicken broth</li>
	<li>¾ c. heavy cream</li>
	<li>¾ c. + 1 tbs. brandy</li>
	<li>1 tsp. juice from one lemon or 1 tsp. champagne vinegar</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
</ul>

### Steaks
<ul>
	<li>4 strip steaks, ¾ – 1 inch thick and no larger than 3 inches at the widest points (8 to 10 ounces each), trimmed of exterior gristle</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>1 tbs. black peppercorns, crushed (finely ground pepper is not a viable substitute)</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
### For the sauce:

Heat 1 tbs. butter in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat; when foaming subsides, add shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add beef and chicken broths, increase heat to high, and boil until reduced to about ½ cup, about 8 minutes. Set reduced broth mixture aside. Rinse and wipe out skillet.

### For the steaks:

Meanwhile, sprinkle both sides of steaks with salt; rub one side of each steak with 1 tsp. crushed peppercorns, and, using fingers, press peppercorns into steaks to make them adhere.

Place now-empty skillet over medium heat until hot, about 4 minutes. Lay steaks unpeppered-side down in hot skillet, increase heat to medium-high, firmly press down on steaks with bottom of cake pan, and cook steaks without moving them until well-browned, about 6 minutes. Using tongs, flip steaks, firmly press down on steaks with bottom of cake pan, and cook on peppered side, about 3 minutes longer for rare, about 4 minutes longer for medium-rare, or about 5 minutes longer for medium. Transfer steaks to large plate and tent loosely with foil to keep warm.

Pour reduced broth, cream, and ¼ c. brandy into now-empty skillet; increase heat to high and bring to boil, scraping pan bottom with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Simmer until deep golden brown and thick enough to heavily coat back of metal tablespoon or soup spoon, about 5 minutes. Off heat, whisk in remaining 3 tbs. butter, remaining 1 tbs. brandy, lemon juice or vinegar, and any accumulated meat juices. Adjust seasonings with salt.

Set steaks on individual dinner plates, spoon portion of sauce over steaks, serve hot.
