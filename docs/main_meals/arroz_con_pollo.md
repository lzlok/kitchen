	<li>2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
	<li>½ tsp. pepper</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>½ c. olive oil</li>
	<li>1 medium green pepper</li>
	<li>2 c. chopped onion</li>
	<li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
	<li>1 bay leaf</li>
	<li>⅛ – ¼ tsp. ground cayenne pepper</li>
	<li>1 tsp. saffron</li>
	<li>2 c. white rice</li>
	<li>1 can (1 lb. 2 oz) tomatoes</li>
	<li>1½ c. chicken broth</li>

	<li>½ c. pimento stuffed green olives, sliced</li>
	<li>1 red pepper, cut in strips</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Wash chicken pieces under cold running water. Drain well. Wipe dry with paper towels. Combine oregano, pepper, and 2 tsp. sat. Sprinkle over chicken. Rub in well. Let stand 10 minutes.

In heavy 6 qt Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Brown chicken a third at a time, until golden brown all over, using tongs to turn chicken — about 30 minutes in all. Remove chicken as it browns. Preheat oven to 350˚F.

Wash peppers, remove ribs and seeds. Cut into lengthwise strips. To drippings in Dutch oven, add onion, garlic, green pepper, bay leaf, and cayenne pepper. Sauté, stirring, over medium heat until onion is tender — 5 minutes.

Using back of spoon, crush saffron threads on a small piece of parchment, or use a mortar and pestle. Add with some salt and the rice to Dutch oven. Cook, stirring, until rice is lightly browned — about 10 minutes. Add undrained tomatoes and chicken broth.

Arrange browned chicken pieces over rice. Bring just to boiling, uncovered. Bake in oven tightly covered, 1 hour.<i> [Note: Can also cook over low heat, tightly covered, instead of baking.] </i>Remove from oven. Add ½ c. water. Do not stir. Sprinkle peas and olives over top. Arrange red pepper strips on top. Bake covered, 20 minutes longer, or until chicken is tender and rice has absorbed all liquid. <i>[Note: If cooking on stove, can just keep on low.]</i> Remove from oven. Let stand, covered, 10 minutes. Serve right from Dutch oven.

Serves 6 – 8.
