## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2 medium onions</li>
	<li>2 tbs. lard</li>
	<li>2½ lb. beef chuck or round, cut as ¾” cubes</li>
	<li>½ lb. beef heart (optional), cut to ¾” cubes</li>
	<li>1 garlic clove</li>
	<li>Pinch of caraway seeds</li>
	<li>2 tbs. paprika</li>
	<li>1 medium tomato, peeled</li>
	<li>2 green frying or Italian peppers</li>
	<li>1 lb. potatoes</li>
	<li>Little dumplings</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Chop onions into coarse pieces and sauté in lard in a large pot over low heat. Cook until onions are glossy. Add meat, then cook for 10 more minutes. Separately, chop and crush the garlic with the caraway seeds and a little salt. Remove pot from heat. Stir in garlic and paprika mixture rapidly. Immediately after, add 2½ qt. <i>warm</i> water (cold water toughens meat). Put pot back on stove and cook for ~1 hour.

Cut tomato into 1” pieces. Core and ring green peppers. Peel potatoes and cut into ¾” pieces. After 1 hour, add to meat. If necessary, add water to make a soupy consistency. Simmer for 30 minutes, then add potatoes and cook until done. Cook dumplings into the stew.

Makes 8 servings.
