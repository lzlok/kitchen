## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>4 lbs. boneless pork shoulder (if you find it with the skin on you will have great crackling capping the roast)</li>
	<li>6 cloves </li>
	<li>1 tbs. cumin (seeds or ground)</li>
	<li>2 tsp. caraway seeds</li>
	<li>3 tbs. coarse sea salt</li>
	<li>2 tsp. ground black pepper</li>
	<li>Two 12 oz dark beer (Marzen, Dunkel, bock or if using ale Amber or Brown)</li>
	<li>1 large onion</li>
	<li>3 carrots, (or more as needed)</li>
	<li>3 beets, (or more as needed)</li>
	<li>3 large sweet potatoes, (or more as needed)</li>
	<li>3 parsnips, (or more as needed)</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Turn the oven on to 350 F. 

Grind the cloves, caraway seeds and cumin seeds (if not using ground cumin) and mix them with the salt and pepper. 

Score the pork shoulder fat cap/skin. Rub it well on all sides with the seasonings mix and place it in a roasting pan with a rack. Make sure that the pork is level, especially if it has the skin on (better crackling will develop). You can place garlic cloves underneath the meat to even it out and achieve a level top surface. Roast the pork shoulder in the middle of the oven for about 1 hour.

Just before taking it out peel and dice all the vegetables in 1 inch or so cubes. Place the vegetables around the meat and pour the two beers over them and the meat. Put the pork roast and the vegetables back in the oven and roast for 1.5 more hours. About half way through check to see if the liquid is getting low. If so, add a bit more beer or a little bit of water. Baste the vegetables with the pan juices and continue to roast until meat registers 155˚F.

Increase the oven temperature if the skin is not browning and bubbling fast enough. If it’s too dark, lower the temperature of your oven to 325 F then broil for about a minute or two at the end. Remove the pork from the pan and let rest on a cutting board before slicing.

For gravy, strain the pan juices and set aside. In a sauce pan over medium heat, melt 2 tbs. butter and whisk in 2 tbs. flour. Add the strained pan juices while continuing to whisk. If you need to thin out the gravy add water, 1 tbs. at a time. Season with salt and pepper.

### Notes
<ul>
	<li>For bigger cuts of pork shoulder or cuts that have the bone in allow extra time. Go with about 20 additional minutes for each extra pound over 4 lbs. Add the additional time to the secondary roasting time in the oven, after you take out the roast to add the vegetables and the beer (plus any extra water or broth). </li>
	<li>If you are not going to use the gravy immediately, keep it warm until you can serve it. Gravy breaks if reheated. Do not let it get cold and then attempt to reheat it on the stove or in the microwave.</li>
</ul>
