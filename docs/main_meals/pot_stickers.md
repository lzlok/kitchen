	<li>Pot sticker wrappers</li>
	<li>Pork</li>
	<li>Cabbage, shredded</li>
	<li>Ginger, minced</li>
	<li>Green onion, cut finely</li>
	<li>Soy sauce</li>
	<li>Sesame oil</li>
	<li>Pepper</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Mix all the filling ingredients together. Stuff potstickers with filling, using water to seal the edge.

To cook, swirl oil in a hot pan. Place pot stickers in pan. Cook until golden on the first side, flip, then cook until golden on the second side. Add just enough water to the pan to coat the bottom of the pan, quickly put the lid on, then cook until the water has just about all evaporated (10 - 12 minutes).

To serve, mix soy sauce with water in a 3:1 ratio. If desired, add sambal.
