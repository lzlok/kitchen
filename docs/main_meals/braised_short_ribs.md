	<li>3 tbs. vegetable oil</li>
	<li>3 medium onions, chopped</li>
	<li>3 medium carrots, peeled, chopped</li>
	<li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
	<li>3 tbs. all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>1 tbs. tomato paste</li>
	<li>One 750 ml bottle of dry red wine (best Cabernet Sauvignon)</li>
	<li>10 sprigs flat-leaf parsley</li>
	<li>8 sprigs thyme</li>
	<li>4 sprigs oregano</li>

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350˚F. Season short ribs with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium high. Working in 2 batches, brown short ribs on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch. Transfer short ribs to a plate. Pour off all but 3 tbs. drippings from pot.

Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onions are browned, about 5 minutes. Add flour and tomato paste. Cook stirring constantly until well-combined and deep red, 2 – 3 minutes. Stir in wine then add short ribs with any accumulated juices. Bring to a boil. Lower heat to medium and simmer until wine is reduced by half, about 25 minutes. Add all herbs to pot along with garlic. Stir in stock. Bring to boil, cover, and transfer to oven.

Cook until short ribs are tender, 2 – 2½ hours. Transfer short ribs to a platter. Strain sauce from pot into a measuring cup. Spoon fat from surface. Of sauce and discard. Season with salt and pepper. Serve in shallow bowls over mashed potatoes with sauce spooned over.
