## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2 tbs. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
	<li>2 oz. chorizo, diced</li>
	<li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
	<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
	<li>½ tsp. Espelette pepper [French chili pepper that has a smoky flavor—substitute Aleppo pepper or pinches of smoked paprika and cayenne pepper]</li>
	<li>1 tsp. Spanish smoked paprika</li>
	<li>1 tsp. salt, more to taste</li>
	<li>1½ c. coarsely chopped cherry tomatoes (about 18)</li>
	<li>1½ c. coarse-textured couscous</li>
	<li>1 lb. large shrimp, shelled and deveined</li>
	<li>⅔ c. dry vermouth or white wine</li>
	<li>1 c. fish stock</li>
	<li>2 lb. mussels, scrubbed</li>
	<li>1 tbs. chopped cilantro leaves</li>
	<li>1 lemon, in 6 wedges</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Heat oil on medium in a 4-quart sauté pan. Add chorizo and let it sizzle a minute or two. Stir in onion, garlic and Espelette and cook until onion is soft. Stir in paprika, salt and tomatoes. Simmer gently about 5 minutes, until tomatoes soften and release their juices. Stir in couscous and cook a few minutes until all ingredients are well- combined.

Add shrimp, folding them in with the rest of the ingredients. Stir in vermouth and stock. Let the liquid come to a simmer. Taste liquid for seasoning and adjust salt and Espelette. Add mussels and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until mussels open, from 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and let rest, covered, 5 minutes. The couscous should be tender and should have absorbed most of the liquid.

Serve directly from the sauté pan or pile the contents on a big, warm platter. Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges.
