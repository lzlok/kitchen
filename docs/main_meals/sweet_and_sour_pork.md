## Instructions
Place cubed pork in a medium bowl and season with 1 tsp. salt, ¼ tsp. sugar, and 1 tsp. soy sauce. Mix in the egg white and green onions. Cover and place in the refrigerator at least 1 hour.

Heat 1 quart of oil to 365˚F in a large, heavy saucepan or deep fryer. Coat the pork with ½ c. cornstarch and fry in the heated oil about 10 minutes until evenly browned. Drain on paper towels.

Heat 1 tbs. oil in a wok over medium heat. Stir in celery, green bell pepper, and onion. Cook until tender. Season with salt and sugar. Remove from heat and set aside.

In a large saucepan, mix 1 c. water, ¼ tsp. salt, ¾ c. sugar, apple cider vinegar, ketchup, and ½ tsp. soy sauce. Bring to a boil, and stir in the cooked pork, celery mixture, and the pineapple chunks with juice. Return to boil and mix in the 2 tbs. cornstarch and ¼ c. water to thicken. Cook until well-blended.
