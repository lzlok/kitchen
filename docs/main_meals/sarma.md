	<li>1 large onion, diced</li>

## Instructions

Microwave the head of the cabbage to soften the leaves. Remove and save the leaves that have softened and microwave cabbage until more leaves soften.

Put half the jar of sauerkraut in the bottom of a pot. Spread evenly.

Mix onion, rice, carrots beef, and tomato paste together. Put the filling in a cabbage leaf and roll the leaf. Put in pot. Repeat until half the amount of filling is used. Put ham hocks on top of the cabbage rolls in the pot then continue filling with cabbage rolls until the rest of the filling is used up. Put the remaining sauerkraut on top of the cabbage and add enough water to cover.

Simmer until cooked, about 2-3 hours or overnight if in a slow cooker.
