## Instructions
### Crust

Mix the dough ingredients, and knead to make a smooth crust. This will take about 7 minutes at medium-low speed in a stand mixer.

Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl or 8-cup measure (which makes it easy to track its rise), cover, and let rise till very puffy, about 60 minutes. During this time, start making the sauce and toppings.

Once the dough has risen, grease deep-dish pizza pan(s) with olive oil. Two 9” cast iron or cake pans work well, or for a thicker crust a 14” pan. Stretch or roll out the dough to make as large a circle as you can. Lay the dough in the pan(s), and stretch it towards the edges until it starts to shrink back. Cover, and let it rest for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425°F while the dough rests.

Continue to stretch the dough to cover the bottom of the pan, then gently push it up the sides of the pan. The olive oil may ooze over the edge of the crust; that's OK. Let the crust rest for another 15 minutes.

Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until it's set and barely beginning to brown.

### Sauce

While the dough rises, prepare the pizza sauce. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the 1 tbs. of olive oil and 1 tbs. butter. Add the minced onion crushed red pepper, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and sugar (optional) and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce has reduced to about 2½ c., about 30 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the fresh basil and olive oil. Check the seasoning and add salt if needed. Cover and set aside.

Bake the pizza at 425˚F for about 25 minutes. Remove it from the oven, and carefully lift it out of the pan onto a rack. Allow the pizza to cool for about 15 minutes (or longer, for less oozing) before cutting and serving.
