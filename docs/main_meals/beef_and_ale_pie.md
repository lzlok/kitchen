## Instructions
Dry the beef thoroughly and season generously with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbs. of the oil in a large oven-proof Dutch oven over medium high heat until shimmering. Add half of the meat so the pieces are close but not touching. Cook not moving the pieces until the sides touching the pot are well-browned (2-3 min.). Turn and cook until most sides are well-browned (~ 5 min.). Remove, add oil, and brown remaining beef. Set aside.

Reduce heat to medium-low, add remaining tbs. oil to the now-empty Dutch oven, and swirl to coat the pan bottom. Add the onions and ¼ tsp. salt and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping the pot bottom with a wooden spoon to loosen the browned bits until the onions have released some moisture (5 minutes). Increase the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally and scraping the pot bottom until the onions are limp, softened, and lightly browned (12-14 minutes). Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant (30 sec). Add the flour and stir until the onions are evenly coated.

Stir in the broth, scraping the pot bottom and edges with a wooden spoon to loosen the browned bits. Add the cubed potatoes, thyme, bay leaf, sugar, and vinegar along with the browned beef and accumulated juices. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover, and place in the oven (or cook on the stovetop) until beef is fork-tender (1½ to 2 hours). Remove and discard the bay leaf. Adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper. Remove beef and potatoes from the pot so only liquid remains.

Add 3 or so tablespoons of flour to the sauce and return to a simmer. Mix the cornstarch in as little cold water as possible to dissolve and add to the sauce. Cook until flour is fully cooked, adding more flour as necessary until sauce is thick enough for the pie. Return meat, peas, and potatoes to pot, mix, and chill. Roll out the bottom crust. Place in an 8”x8” glass dish about 2 – 3 inches tall. Trim so the crust is even with the edges of the dish. Fill with pie weights and bake at 425˚F, removing weights halfway through baking and pricking with holes so crust does not bubble. Remove when crust is fully baked.

Fill the pie with the carbonnade à la Flamande filling (must be chilled) and top with remaining rolled out crust. Bake at 425˚F until top crust is golden brown. Serve cool.
