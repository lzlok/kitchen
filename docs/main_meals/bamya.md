## Instructions

### Broth

Melt the ghee in a large, hot, heavy bottom pan. Add the whole spices and stir for 1 minute until fragrant. Dry the meat cubes and sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Sear the meat cubes on all sides in the hot ghee. Don't cram the meat in the pan, or they will steam instead of sear. When the meat cubes become seared with a golden crust, add the garlic and chopped onions and stir for 1 minute to sauté the onions and garlic. Sprinkle the Boharat (meat spices) and then add the water and let broth simmer for 60 - 90 minutes or until the meat is fork tender.

### Bamya (okra)

In a hot pan, heat some ghee, sauté the minced onions and garlic, and then add okra. Sauté for a couple of minutes until fragrant. Add the tomato juice/sauce, tomato paste, cooked beef cubes, and broth, and let them simmer together in a Dutch oven or pot on the stovetop over medium-low heat. Alternatively, you can transfer everything to a clay pot and finish the dish in the oven.

### Make the Tasha

In a small skillet over medium-low heat, add the ghee, minced garlic, ground coriander, and fresh chopped cilantro, if using. Once the mixture becomes fragrant, add it to the Bamya bel Lahma. If cooking in a pot, cover the pot, and let the stew gently simmer on low for another 10 minutes. Alternately, add the Bamya Bel Lahma to a clay pot after it is half cooked in the pot. Arrange some tomato slices on top, add the tasha, and transfer the clay pot to a preheated oven at 375˚F and cook in the oven for 15-20 minutes.
