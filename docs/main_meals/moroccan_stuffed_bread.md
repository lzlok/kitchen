## Ingredients

### Bread
<ul>
	<li>2 c. flour</li>
	<li>1 c. whole wheat flour</li>
	<li>1 c. flour</li>
	<li>3 tbs. yeast</li>
	<li>Pinch of salt</li>
	<li>500ml water, warm</li>
</ul>

### Filling
<ul>
	<li>1.5lb beef</li>
	<li>1 bundle of green onions, diced</li>
	<li>1 onion</li>
	<li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
	<li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
	<li>¾ – 1 bouquet of parsley</li>
	<li>½ - ¾ of a 14oz can of tomatoes</li>
	<li>2-3 tbs. paprika</li>
	<li>2-3 tbs. cumin</li>
	<li>1 tsp. ground pepper</li>
	<li>1 tsp. ginger</li>
	<li>½ tsp. or less of turmeric</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

### Bread
Proof the yeast with some of the warm water. Mix dough ingredients. Knead bread. Let rise for 1 hour or until doubled or tripled in volume.

### Filling
As soon as the bread is mixed and set aside to rise, start the filling. Sautée the onions in oil until they start to turn translucent. Add the bell pepper and sautée until mostly cooked. Add the parsley and sautée. Add the spices. Add the ground beef and tomatoes. Cook until ground beef is cooked and flavors are blended. As the mixture is cooking, adjust seasoning as needed. Adding more tomatoes if too sour. Set aside to cool before shaping the bread.

### Assembly
Tear off a piece of dough about the size of a billiard ball. Flatten until the dough is roughly half an inch thin or slightly thinner. Place a very generous scoop of meat in the center (the maximum that you can fit in the dough). Pull the edges together to the center to form a ball, just like shaping a Chinese bao. Once the ball is sealed, flatten to form a very thick disk. Do not flatten too much -- the bread will be flattened again on the pan.

Place the shaped bread on a greased, hot griddle. Flatten until slightly thinner than the desired thickness. Cook until golden on each side. Be careful not to overcook! You just need to cook a thin piece of dough on each side.

Should make 8 stuffed breads with leftover filling
