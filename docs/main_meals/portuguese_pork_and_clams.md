## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2 lb. boneless pork butt, cut into 1” cubes</li>
	<li>1½ c. dry white wine</li>
	<li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped</li>
	<li>Dash of Piri Piri (oil, hot dried red peppers, whisky)</li>
	<li>1½ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>½ tsp. ground pepper</li>
	<li>2 bay leaves</li>
	<li>¼ c. olive oil</li>
	<li>4 tsp. paprika</li>
	<li>2 medium onions, thinly sliced</li>
	<li>2 lb. small clams</li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> Mama usually makes these without the clams.

## Instructions
Mix pork cubes, wine, garlic, Piri Piri, 1 tsp of the salt, ¼ tsp. of the pepper, and bay leaves in a large bowl. Marinate for 2 hours. Drain meat well, reserving the marinade

Heat a frying pan and brown the pork in 2 tbs. of olive oil. Place meat and oil in an 8 qt. heavy stove-top casserole and add the reserved marinade and the paprika. Simmer the meat in the juices, uncovered, until the juices almost evaporate, about 45 minutes. Skim fat and discard bay leaves.

Separately, sauté onions in remaining oil until tender but not discolored. Add clams, remaining ½ tsp. salt, and remaining ¼ tsp. of pepper. Cook on high, covered, for 5 minutes until clams open. Add to pork, heat, then serve.
