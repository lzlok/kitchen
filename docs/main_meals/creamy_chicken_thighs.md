	<li>Salt and pepper</li>
	<li>Italian seasoning (divided)</li>
	<li>2 tbsp butter</li>
	<li>1 medium onion diced</li>
	<li>3 garlic cloves chopped</li>

	<li>½ c. white wine</li>
	<li>1 c. chicken stock</li>
	<li>½ c. heavy cream</li>
	<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 400˚F. Heat 1 tbs. olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken thighs with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning. Cook chicken thighs on medium-high skin side down first to brown it for 4-5 minutes. Flip and cook on the next side for about 4 minutes, for a total of 8-10 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet.

Add 2 tbsp butter, onion and sauté until the onion is browned, 3-4 minutes. Add chopped garlic, thyme and 1 tsp Italian seasoning and cook for another minute. Next add 1 tbs. flour and cook it in the oil of the pan for only a minute, until it’s no longer white. Add the wine slowly to the hot pan, increasing heat from medium-high to high and cook for a few minutes. Now add chicken stock and heavy cream. Stir to combine and let everything cook until it reduces slightly, about 5 minutes.&nbsp;Make sure to taste the sauce and add salt and pepper, to taste.

Return chicken thighs back into the pan with sauce.&nbsp;Put in the oven uncovered and cook at 400˚ for 35 minutes.&nbsp;Once time is up, take the pan out of the oven, check if chicken thighs are done. Sprinkle with fresh thyme and serve with roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes or rice.
