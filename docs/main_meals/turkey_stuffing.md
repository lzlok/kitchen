## Instructions
Sauté onions, celery, chestnuts. Season with black pepper and cinnamon. Add bread cubes. Mix well. Transfer to a large bowl. [Can stop here and continue the next day when turkey will be roasted.] Put milk in a separate large bowl, add a teaspoon of baking soda; stir to dissolve. Add ground pork and knead with hand until milk is incorporated into pork. Add kielbasa and mix well. 

If cooking stuffing separate from the turkey (unstuffed turkey), put stuffing in baking pan. Pour a mixture of broth from the turkey giblets, and white wine over the stuffing. Wait for turkey to be roasted and pour some of the drippings over the stuffing. Use water or chicken broth if more liquid is needed. Bake for 45 minutes at 350 F, covered.
