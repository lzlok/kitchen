## Instructions
### Fritters

Cut the leeks into scant 1” thick slices; rinse and drain dry. Sauté the leeks and shallots in a pan with half the oil on medium heat for about 15 minutes or until soft. Transfer to a large bowl and add the chile, parsley, spices, sugar, and salt. Allow to cool down.

Whisk the egg white to soft peaks and fold it into the vegetables. In another bowl, mix together the flours, baking powder, whole egg, milk, and butter to form a batter. Gently mix it into the egg white and vegetable mixture.

Put 2 tbs. of the remaining oil in a large frying pan and place over a medium heat. Spoon about half of the vegetable mixture into the pan to make four large fritters. Fry them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until golden and crisp. Remove to paper towels and keep warm.

### Sauce

Blitz all the ingredients together in a food processor until a uniform green. Set aside for later.
