	<li>⅛ tsp. nutmeg</li>

## Instructions
Mix filling ingredients together. Preheat oven to 350˚. Spread a slightly damp cloth on the counter. Remove dough from package. Place 2 strudel leaves on the damp cloth. Brush with butter and sprinkle with half the crumbs and half the sugar. Place 2 more leaves on top, brush with butter, and sprinkle with remaining crumbs and sugar. Spread either fruit filling over dough, leaving 2-inch border. Fold dough leaves along the side borders over the filling and seal well; then roll up the strudel like a jelly roll. Place on a buttered baking sheet or jelly roll pan, seam side down. Brush strudel with butter. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot or cold.

To freeze: butter a double thickness of foil, place the unbaked strudel on foil, butter the strudel, and wrap it up. Freeze. Do not defrost; unwrap and bake still frozen in a 350˚ preheated oven on a cookie sheet for 35-40 minutes, or until golden brown.

Makes 1 strudel, 6-8 slices
