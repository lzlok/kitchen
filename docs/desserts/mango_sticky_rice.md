## Instructions
Pour 1 c. of cold water in the Instant Pot. Add a steamer basket. In a stainless-steel bowl, add 1 c. glutinous rice and ⅔ c. cold water. Ensure all the rice is submerged. Place bowl on top of steamer basket. Pressure cook at high pressure for 12 minutes then 12 minutes natural release.

While rice is natural releasing, add ¼ c. + 1 tbs. sugar, a pinch of salt, and ⅔ c. coconut milk in a saucepan. Warm mixture over medium-low heat just so sugar fully dissolves. Remove mixture from heat and pour onto sticky rice. Gently fluff and mix. Let sit 30 – 60 minutes until coconut mixture is fully soaked.

Toast coconut flakes on a skillet on medium heat until golden brown, stirring occasionally (2 – 3 minutes).

### Coconut Sauce

In a mixing bowl, mix 2 tbs. coconut milk with 1 tbs. cornstarch. In the saucepan, add ½ c. coconut milk, 2 tbs. sugar, 2 pinches of salt. Bring mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Thicken the sauce by slowly adding the coconut cornstarch mixture to the simmering coconut milk mixture. Mix well and remove from heat.

### Serve

Place mango on sticky rice and drizzle with coconut sauce. Tastes best if left to sit first for 1 – 2days. Sprinkle with coconut flakes before serving.
