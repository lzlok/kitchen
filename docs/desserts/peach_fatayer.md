## Ingredients
### Dough

<ul>
	<li>2½ c. all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>11 g (~3½ tsp) instant yeast</li>
	<li>1 tbs. sugar</li>
	<li>½ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>¾ c. whole milk, lukewarm</li>
	<li>⅓ c olive oil</li>
</ul>

### Filling

<ul>
	<li>1½ c. peaches, cubed</li>
	<li>¾ c. toasted ground walnuts</li>
	<li>¼ c. honey, preferably raw</li>
</ul>


## Instructions
Add yeast, sugar, salt, and yeast to the milk. Then, add this milk to the all-purpose flour and mix. Now, add in the olive oil and knead for a couple of minutes. Cover with a damp muslin cloth and let rest for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, mix the filling.

After the dough has sat for 10 minutes, make small dough balls. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the balls into a circular shape and place a tablespoon or two of the filling in the middle. Fold over the edges of the circle to make an equilateral triangle. (The edges of the triangle should be inscribed in the circle.)

Bake in a preheated oven of 180˚C for about 15 – 20 minutes. Serve hot.
