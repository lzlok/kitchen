## Instructions
Preheat oven to 350˚F. Pour butter into 9” springform cake pan regular 9” round pan will be too shallow) and grease all sides of pan. Evenly sprinkle brown sugar over the butter. Fan banana slices (cut side down) out from center of pan like the spokes of a wheel. Fill in the gaps between slices with short pieces. Add 8 – 10 short banana pieces around sides of pan (cut side on pan).

In large bowl, whisk together flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, optional salt.

In separate bowl, whisk together wet ingredients (egg, buttermilk, sour cream, oil, vanilla extract). Add wet mixture to dry one, mixing lightly or folding in until just combined. Small lumps will be present, don’t overmix or try to stir them smooth.

Pour batter into pan, filling no more than ¾ high. Discard remainder of batter if necessary.

Bake 40 minutes or until center is set, not jiggly, lightly golden browned, and springy to the touch. Toothpick should come out clean.

Cool for at least 1 hour before serving and inverting. Serve with salted caramel sauce (optional). Can keep airtight at room temperature for up to 5 days.
