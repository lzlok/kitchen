## Ingredients

<ul>
	<li>~2 medium-sized Yukon gold potatoes, peeled</li>
	<li>~ 3 tbs. butter</li>
	<li>~ 3 tbs. milk</li>
	<li>1 egg</li>
	<li>1 – 1½ c. flour</li>
	<li>Prune plums</li>
	<li>~ 2 tbs. oil</li>
	<li>½ c. breadcrumbs</li>
</ul>


## Instructions
Cook potatoes in salted water until tender Add butter and mash them until very smooth. Add milk and continue to mash until milk is blended. When potatoes are cool, add egg and knead until egg is blended. Add ½ c. of flour and knead in. Add more flour and knead in. Add enough flour until the mixture has the same texture as your ear love and is not sticky.

Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.

In a skillet, warm the oil over low heat. Add the breadcrumbs and stir every so often so that the crumbs will be evenly browned. Stop when the breadcrumbs are lightly browned. Turn off heat and set aside next to the large pot of water.

Cut the prune plums in half lengthwise. Put into knedle.

Drop the knedle into the pot of boiling water. When the knedle come to the surface, cook for another 4 – 5 minutes, depending on size. If the surface starts to disintegrate, it’s being cooked too long.

Remove with a slotted spoon and immediately put into the pan of breadcrumbs. Roll each knedle until well-coated with crumbs.
