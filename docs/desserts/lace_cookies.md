## Ingredients

<ul>
	<li>1 stick (½ c.) unsalted butter, softened</li>
	<li>¾ c. firmly packed brown sugar</li>
	<li>2 tbs. all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>2 tbs. milk</li>
	<li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
	<li>1¼ c. old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
</ul>


## Instructions
Cream butter with sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the flour, milk, and vanilla. Stir in oats. Drop rounded teaspoons of the dough about 3” apart onto ungreased baking sheets and bake in batches in the middle of a preheated 350˚F oven for 10 – 12 minutes until golden. Let cookies stand on the sheets for 1 minute or until they are just firm enough to be moved. If desired, turn cookies upside down on the sheets and roll into cylinders. Cool.

Makes ~40 cookies.
