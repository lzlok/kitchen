## Ingredients

<ul>
	<li>1½ c. strong black coffee, room temperature</li>
	<li>1 tbs. instant espresso powder</li>
	<li>9 tbs. dark rum</li>
	<li>6 large egg yolks</li>
	<li>⅔ c. sugar</li>
	<li>¼ tsp. table salt</li>
	<li>1½ lbs. mascarpone</li>
	<li>¾ c. heavy cream, cold plus 1 tbs.</li>
	<li>½ tsp. unflavored gelatin</li>
	<li>14 oz. lady fingers (2 boxes from Trader Joe’s)</li>
	<li>3½ tbs. Cocoa, preferably Dutch processed</li>
	<li>¼ c. semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, grated</li>
</ul>


## Instructions
Stir coffee, espresso, and 5 tbs. rum in wide bowl until espresso dissolves. Set aside.

Use a hand mixer to beat egg yolks in a bowl placed over a pot of boiling water on the stove. Once yolks are just combined, add sugar and salt, beating at medium high speed until pale yellow (1½ min.), scraping down sides of bowl. Take off heat. Add remaining rum and beat at medium speed until just combined (20 – 30 seconds). Scrape bowl. Add mascarpone and beat at medium speed until no lumps remain (30 – 45 seconds). Transfer to large bowl and set aside.

In a small bowl, add 1 tbs whipping cream. Sprinkle the gelatin on the cream and let sit for about 10 minutes; stir. A bit of cool water may be added if there's no enough for the gelatin to soak. After about 10 minutes, microwave for 5 seconds at a time until the gelatin dissolves. Cool slightly (about a minute). Add a tablespoon more of whipping cream (from the ¾c. amount) and stir to incorporate into the warm cream. If the gelatin becomes firm because it was cooled too much, heat it and it will liquefy.

In the now-empty bowl used for the eggs (no need to clean), beat cream at medium speed until frothy (1 – 1½ min.). Slowly pour in the gelatin cream. Increase to high and beat until stiff peaks form. Fold ⅓ of the whipped cream into mascarpone mixture, then fold in remaining cream until no white streaks remain. Set aside.

Roll ladyfingers in coffee mixture and line bottom of 13” x 9” glass or ceramic baking dish. Spread half of mascarpone mixture over lady fingers. Dust 2 tbs. of cocoa over mascarpone with a fine mesh strainer. Repeat with remaining ladyfingers, mascarpone, and cocoa. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 6 – 24 hours. Sprinkle with chocolate.

Serves 10 – 12.
