## Instructions
### Log

Grease bottom of a 15½-by-10½-by-1-inch jelly roll pan. Line with parchment paper. Grease lightly. Preheat the oven to 375˚F.

In a large bowl, at high speed, beat egg whites just until soft peaks form when the beater is slowly raised.

Add ¼ c. sugar, 2 tbs. at a time, beating until stiff peaks form when beater is slowly raised.

With the same beaters, beat yolks at high speed, adding remaining ½ c. sugar, 2 tbs. at a time. Beat until mixture is very thick — about 4 minutes. At low speed, beat in cocoa, vanilla, and salt, just until smooth.

With wire whisk or rubber scraper, using and under-and-over motion, gently fold the cocoa mixture into the beaten egg whites, just until they are blended (no egg white should show.

Spread evenly in pan. Bake 15 minutes, just until surface springs back when gently pressed with fingertip.

Sift confectioners’ sugar, in a 15-by-10-inch rectangle on clean linen towel. Turn cake out on sugar, lift off pan. Peel paper off cake. Roll up, jelly-roll fashion, starting with the short end, towel and all. Cool completely on rack, seam side down — at least ½ hour.

### Filling

Combine ingredients in medium bowl. Beat with electric mixer until thick and then refrigerate.

Unroll cake. Spread with filling to 1 inch from edge. Reroll. Place, seam side down, on plate. Cover loosely with foil. Refrigerate 1 hour before serving.

Serves 10.
