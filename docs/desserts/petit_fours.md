## Instructions

### Ladyfinger Génoise
Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat to 350˚F. Grease a 9-inch square pan with solid shortening, dust with flour, and fit the bottom of the ban with a parchment paper square. 

Pour the melted butter into a 1-quart bowl; reserve. 

Sift flour, 1 tbs. of the sugar, and the salt onto a piece of parchment paper and set aside. 

In a bowl at low speed, whisk together the eggs, yolks, and 1 tbs. of the sugar. Whisk in the remaining sugar. At medium speed, whip the mixture until it is airy, pale and tripled in volume, like softly whipped cream (4 to 5 minutes). When you lift the whisk, the mixture should fall back into the bowl in a ribbon that rests on the surface for about 10 seconds. Pour in the vanilla extract during the last moments of whipping. 

Sprinkle about one third of the flour mixture over the batter. Fold in the flour with a rubber spatula, stopping as soon as the flour is incorporated. Fold in the rest of the flour in 2 more additions. 

Gently spoon about 1 c. of the batter into the bowl with the melted butter and fold the butter in with the rubber spatula. Fold this mixture into the batter in the mixer bowl. (This is the point at which the batter is at its most fragile, so fold gingerly.) 

Immediately pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top, creating a slight ridge of batter around the edges. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the top springs back when lightly prodded and the cake starts to come away from the sides of the pan. Transfer the cake to a rack and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. 

When sufficiently cooled, invert the cake onto a rack. Peel off the paper liner, flip it, and put it back on the cake. Flip the cake so it is right side up on the rack. 

The cake can remain uncovered at room temperature for a day or wrapped in plastic for 2 days. For longer storage, freeze wrapped for up to 10 days.

### Syrup
Stir the wine and sugar together in a small bowl until the sugar dissolves.

### Glaze
Put the chopped chocolate into a heat-safe medium bowl. In a heavy-bottomed 1½ quart saucepan, heat the cream just until boiling then pour over the chocolate, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula until smooth. Push it through a strainer into a bowl.

### Assembly
Cut the cake in half horizontally. Place the bottom layer, cut side up, on a cardboard cake round or the removable bottom of a tart pan. {Or an inverted baking pan.} Brush the sweet wine syrup over the cut side of the layer. Spread a thin layer of jelly over the cake and cover with the top layer.

#### For round petit fours:
Cut the cake into rounds using a 1½ inch biscuit or cookie cutter to cut as many rounds from the cake as you can, about 24. Put the small rounds on wire racks, leaving an inch between each one, and place the racks on a waxed paper-lined jelly roll pan or sheet pan.

#### Glaze
Use the glaze while it’s still warm and liquid. To test, spread a little of the glaze over a piece of white bread; it should seep in just a bit. (If the glaze has cooled and is no longer spreadable, heat it over a pan of hot water.) 

Pour the warm glaze over the cake and spread it evenly across the top, using a flexible metal icing spatula. Don’t be concerned if some of the glaze dribbles down the sides of the cake. If making mini rounds, ladle about 2 tbs. of the glaze over each little cake, allowing it to run over the top and down the sides to cover the cakes completely. When you’ve gone through your batch of glaze, scrape up whatever has dripped onto the jelly-roll pan, push it though a sieve (since some cake crumbs may have gotten mixed in), and reheat over hot water. When the glaze is warm, continue coating the remaining cakes.

#### For the Florentine pattern:
Spoon the melted chocolate into 2 small parchment paper piping cones or a zipper-lock plastic bag with the smallest possible opening sniped from the corner. Before the chocolate cools, pipe several lines of milk chocolate across the surface of the cake; don’t be concerned about spacing them just so or keeping them perfectly straight — even squiggles will come out fine in the end. Pipe semisweet chocolate lines in the same fashion. Draw a fork across the lines, pulling the chocolate just a little to create a marbled effect. Let the glaze dry at room temperature for 1 hour, or chill until set.

#### For the plain chocolate pattern:
Half fill a small parchment paper piping cone or a zipper-lock plastic bag with the smallest possible opening snipped from the corner with the dark chocolate. While the white chocolate glaze is still warm and hasn’t set, decorate the cakes by piping several tiny dots on each cake with the dark chocolate, piping one dot and drawing a toothpick through it to create a heart, or piping lines or squiggles. Add crystalized violets if desired. Allow the glaze and decorations to set (1 to 2 hours). With a small metal spatula, carefully lift the cakes onto a serving platter.

#### To cut round petit fours:
When you’re ready to cut the cake, have ready a long, serrated knife, a small glass of hot water, paper towels, and a 12-inch ruler. Trim a sliver of cake from each side.

Using the ruler as a guide, mark small notches in the glaze with the tip of a knife every 1½ inches across the top and the bottom of the cake. (Depending on how much the cake has shrunk or been trimmed, you may have to measure off a bit less than 1½ inches.) Repeat this procedure down the sides, making sure that the notches line up directly across from one another. Dip the knife into the hot water, wipe it with a paper towel, and using just the tip of the knife and the ruler as your guide, score the glaze (don’t cut through the cake) in straight lines from one notch to another so that the pattern for cutting squares is formed.

Now, cut through the scored lines, heating and cleaning your knife between cuts.

#### To serve
Once glazed and cut, the cake should be served within an hour or two, but if you cut it and don’t separate the pieces, you can keep the cake for several hours. 

Makes thirty-six 1½ inch squares
