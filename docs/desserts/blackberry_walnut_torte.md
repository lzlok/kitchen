## Instructions
### Cake

Preheat oven to 350˚F. Grease two 9” round cake pans. Line bottoms of pans with parchment or waxed paper. Grease and flour paper and sides of pans, shaking out excess flour. Finely grind walnuts with flour in processor. Transfer to bowl. Stir in baking powder and salt. Using electric mixer, cream yolks, sugar, and vanilla until very thick and pale. Using clean, dry beaters, beat whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Gradually add powdered sugar and beat until stiff but not dry. Gently fold ⅓ of whites into yolk mixture. Fold in half of nut mixture. Fold in ⅓ of whites. Fold in remaining nut mixture. Fold in remaining whites.

Pour batter into prepared pans, smoothing tops. Bake until cake begins to pull away from sides of pan and top is lightly browned, about 25 minutes. Run knife around sides of pan. Cool 10 minutes. Invert cake onto rack, remove paper, and reinvert onto rack. Cool completely. <i>(Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Wrap in waxed paper and store at room temperature.)</i>

### For cream

Sprinkle gelatin over kirsch in heavy small saucepan. Let stand 5 minutes. Stir over low heat until gelatin dissolves. Cool; do not let set.

Using electric mixer, beat cream cheese until smooth. Add sugar, yolks, and vanilla and beat until creamy. Stir in dissolved gelatin. Beat cream to soft peaks. Fold into cream cheese mixture. Chill at least 3 hours or overnight.

### For frosting

Melt chocolate in double boiler set over gently simmering water stir until smooth. Cool 30 minutes. Beat in sour cream and vanilla. Stir frequently while icing torte.

### To assemble

Cut each cake into 2 layers. Reserve best layer for top. Set 1 layer on 8- or 9-inch removable tart pan bottom or cardboard round. Spread with ⅓ of the cream. Top with second cake layer. Spread with stirred jam, then ½ of cream. Top with third cake layer. Spread with remaining cream. Top fourth cake layer. Brush off crumbs. Compress sides of cake to even layers; scrape off excluded cream and jam. Spread top with melted jam. Spread some of frosting on sides. Spoon remaining frosting into pastry bag fitted with ¼” open star tip. Pipe frosting around top and bottom edge of torte. Refrigerate up to 8 hours. Let stand at room temperature 1 hour before serving.
