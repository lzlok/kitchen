## Instructions

### Dough

Cream the butter and gradually beat in the sugar, then the egg yolk. Combine the flour with the salt and baking powder and stir into the butter mixture. Work with hands to form a ball. Press the dough with your fingers into and up the sides of a loose-bottom quiche pan. Refrigerate while preparing the custard.

### Custard

Heat the milk with the lemon peel to the boiling point. Reduce the heat and simmer 10 minutes. Discard the lemon peel. Place the egg yolks in a saucepan and gradually stir in the sugar. Beat with a wire whisk until the yolks are pale yellow. Beat in the flour and gradually add the hot milk. Cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until thickened and smooth and no flour taste remains. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Cool, stirring occasionally.

### Assemble

While the custard is cooling, combine in a small bowl the sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon for the filling. Mix with the sliced apples.

Spread the custard over the dough and arrange the apples on top in overlapping circles. Bake at 350 F for about 1 hour, or until the crust is well browned. Cool.

In a small saucepan, melt the apple jelly. Spoon over the apples to glaze the tart. Remove the sides of the quiche pan, leaving the tart on the bottom circle. Serve at room temperature or chilled.

One recipe makes three 4” tartlets or one 9”tart.
