## Ingredients

### Cake
<ul>
	<li>5 eggs, separated (use large, not jumbo)</li>
	<li>Pinch of salt</li>
	<li>½ c. granulated sugar</li>
	<li>½ c. pastry flour </li>
	<li>Unsalted butter, softened</li>
	<li>⅔ c. granulated sugar for caramel topping</li>
</ul>

### Filling
<ul>
	<li>2-inch piece of vanilla bean or 1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
	<li>¾ c. confectioner’s sugar</li>
	<li>6 oz. unsalted butter, softened</li>
	<li>3 tbs. prepared strong espresso coffee, or 3 level teaspoons instant coffee powder mixed with 3 tablespoons water</li>
	<li>1 egg (optional))</li>
	<li>3 oz. semisweet chocolate</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

### Cake
Preheat oven to 375F.

Whip the 5 egg whites with 1 tbs. ice water and a pinch of salt until stiff.

Add the egg yolks, one by one, beating for 1 minute after each addition. Add ½ c. of the sugar, spoon by spoon, whipping all the time.

If you are using an electric mixer, turn down to lowest speed before adding the flour. Add flour, little by little, making sure that it is completely blended into the egg mixture.

Line a 17x12-inch baking sheet with parchment paper, and lightly spread it with 2 tbs. butter or oil. Pour the batter on the baking sheet. Tap sides a few times to even it out. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 - 12 minutes, until golden brown. 

Cut the cake into 6 even pieces each 8½ by 4 inches. Pull off the parchment paper. Cover the pieces with cloth or parchment paper while cooling to retain some of the moisture. Set aside the best of the 6 pieces of cake to use for the top of the cake.

### Filling
Split the vanilla bean and scrape out the insides into the sugar. Mix sugar with butter, prepared coffee and the whole egg. Beat into a creamy mixture. 

Soften the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over hot water, or in a low oven, and mix into the filling. {Or microwave on low setting, #3 power level, for 1 minute and then check how soft, stir, repeat until all is melted.} 

Cool the filling in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before using it.

### Making the caramel layer
Melt ⅔ c. granulated sugar in a heavy frying pan; stir it with a buttered spoon as it cooks over very low heat. The sugar at first will look like dirty snow, then it will dissolve into a walnut-colored shiny liquid.

Immediately remove it from the heat and spoon it directly from frying pan onto the top cake layer on the marble slab. Score it with intended portion sizes with the tip of a buttered knife, then cut it all the way through with the buttered knife. You must work fast because the caramel hardens in less than a minute. Do not touch the sugar with your hands. 

### Assembly
Spread a little unsalted butter on a marble slab and place the chosen cake layer on it. 

Spread the chocolate filling on the other 5 layers; the filling layers should be about ⅛-inch thick. Put the layers together and frost the sides. Put the rest of the filling in a pastry bag. 

When the caramel layer is cool, put it on top of the filled layers. Fit a No. 6 piping tube to the pastry bag and pipe a decorative border of chocolate filling around the top edge of the torte. 

Cool the cake in the refrigerator until the filling is firm, 3 to 4 hours. Slice the cake with a knife dipped into hot water. Cake will keep in refrigerator for as long as 10 days.
