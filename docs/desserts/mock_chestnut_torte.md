{: .no_toc }
---
<b>Note:</b> This cake is tastes like a normal chocolate cake and is therefore very good if you need to cook a gluten free dessert.

## Ingredients
## Torte

<ul>
	<li>½ c. (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
	<li>⅓ c. plus 2 tbs. sugar</li>
	<li>6 large eggs, separated</li>
	<li>1½ c. cooked and mashed sweet potatoes</li>
	<li>1 tsp. rum extract (optional)</li>
	<li>10 oz good-quality semi-sweet chocolate, melted and cooled</li>
	<li>¼ tsp. salt</li>
</ul>

### Glaze

<ul>
	<li>½ c. water</li>
	<li>6 oz semi-sweet chocolate, coarsely chopped</li>
</ul>


## Instructions
Preheat oven to 350˚F. Line a 9” springform pan with baking parchment.

### Torte

In a mixing bowl, cream the unsalted butter with ⅓ c. sugar. Blend in egg yolks, then sweet potatoes and rum extract and chocolate.

In another bowl, whip egg whites gently until they are a bit foamy. Slowly add salt and remaining sugar to form stiff, glossy (but not dry) peaks. Fold ⅓ of the egg whites into the batter. Then, fold in remaining whites carefully. Bake in cake pan for 40 minutes until the cake rises and looks dry and <i>slightly</i> cracked on top. The middle should be soft but firm. Cool in the pan for 20 minutes then remove to a wire rack. Can freeze for up to a month. Chill for at least 1 – 2 hours.

### Glaze

In a double boiler, bring water to a gentle boil and add chopped chocolate all at once. Remove from heat and stir briskly with a whisk until all chocolate melts and you have a thick glaze or sauce-like topping. Refrigerate for ~1 hour.

Invert cake onto plate so the bottom faces up. Spread chocolate ganache glaze over cake. Can be served with chocolate curls, strawberries, raspberries. 

Makes 14 – 18 servings.
