</ul>

	<li>175g sugar</li>
	<li>1¼ tsp. vanilla extract</li>

	<li>20g unsalted butter, softened</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

### Cake
Preheat oven to 375F -- 400F.

It is worth making the sponge cake sheets in twos (mix the dough and bake them), because if we make them all at once, the sponge cake will collapse by the time we want to bake the fourth sheet.

Mix 2 egg yolks with 16g of powdered sugar, and beat 2 egg whites with 16g of powdered sugar until stiff.

Stir 33g of flour into the egg yolk mixture and drizzle in 12g of melted butter.

Carefully fold the egg whites into the mixture. Spread the finished dough on 2 pre-marked baking sheets, grease with a spatula, and shape into a 22cm circle within the frame. Bake for about 8-10 minutes. Repeat this process twice more, resulting in 6 sponge cake bases.

### Filling
Beat the eggs, sugar, vanilla, and salt in a double boiler until it thickens slightly. Do not let the water come to a boil at any time; that will make the eggs curdle. Take the mixture off the heat and continue beating it until it cools slightly. Set aside and leave it to cool a bit more. Stir from time to time.

In a separate double boiler or in the microwave, melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Let it cool slightly and add it to the egg mixture. Incorporate well. Leave the mixture to come to room temperature.

Place the butter (at room temperature) in a bowl and beat it until creamy. Add the unsweetened cocoa powder and incorporate.

Add the chocolate mixture to the butter one tablespoon at a time and mix thoroughly in between so that it doesn't curdle. Having both the chocolate mixture and the butter at room temperature is very important as well. If their temperature is different, the buttercream will curdle.

### Making the caramel layer
Place sugar, vinegar, and butter in a pan. Let it start to caramelize, and then start stirring gently. Be careful not to burn the sugar; it will taste bitter, and you will have to start again. The right color should be a nice reddish-brown, like amber.

Take the caramel off the heat and quickly spread it on the chosen cake layer using the long buttered spatula. Work very quickly!

Immediately start cutting the caramel cake layer into 12, 14, or 16 slices, depending on how large the cake portions should be. Work quickly. Set aside until you are ready to assemble the Dobos cake.

### Assembly
Spread a little unsalted butter on a marble slab and place the chosen cake layer on it. 

Spread the chocolate filling on the other 5 layers; the filling layers should be about ⅛-inch thick. Put the layers together and frost the sides. Put the rest of the filling in a pastry bag. 

When the caramel layer is cool, put it on top of the filled layers. Fit a No. 6 piping tube to the pastry bag and pipe a decorative border of chocolate filling around the top edge of the torte. 

Cool the cake in the refrigerator until the filling is firm, 3 to 4 hours. Slice the cake with a knife dipped into hot water. Cake will keep in refrigerator for as long as 10 days.

## Notes
<ul>
	<li>If the buttercream curdles, you can fix it by beating it at high speed or gently heating it in a double boiler while mixing until smooth. Just don't let it get too warm or melt. </li>
	<li>When I tried to make this, the 6 eggs only filled two quarter sheet pans because they collapsed so much during mixing. If concerned about this, mix all 6 eggs at once and bake the two quarter sheets of cake simultaneously. Then, cut each pan into 3 slices and stack to make a 6 layer cake. The frosting recipe above should be 25% more than the exact amount needed for a cake made with two quarter sheet pans. If following the size of cake in the main recipe, consider increasing the frosting otherwise it may be incredibly exact or slightly too little.</li>
