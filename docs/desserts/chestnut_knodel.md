## Instructions

### Filling
If using fresh chestnuts, cut an X into the chestnuts on the convex side, pour into a pot, cover with water, and cook about 30 minutes or until soft. Test for doneness by peeling and tasting the chestnut. Peel all chestnuts. Then weigh required amount. 

Grate chestnuts and stir together with powdered sugar, vanilla, and rum. Chill. 

### Knödeln
Wash potatoes, boil, peel, and let cool for a bit and press through a potato press while still hot. This should yield about 250 g (½ lb.) of potato mixture. While still warm, quickly work the mixture into a potato dough with flour, semolina, salt, butter, and egg yolk. Roll out the potato dough on a floured surface about 2mm thick (1/12 inch). Cut out pieces from the dough 6 cm (2⅓ inches) long. 

Divide the chestnut mixture into three equal portions. Shape two portions into thumb-sized rolls. Put the rest of the chestnut mixture aside for decoration. Cut off 9 pieces from each chestnut roll and place on the dough pieces. {I don’t follow these directions I take a measuring scoop and take uniform scoops out of the chestnut mixture. Shape each scoop into balls and refrigerate again to make it a bit firm.} 

Shape into Knödel with lightly floured hands.

Place the Knödel in boiling water and cook over low heat about 10 mintues until done. Press the rest of the chestnut mixture through a grater or crumble it with a fork. 

Remove chestnut Knödel from the water with a straining ladle, drain well, and roll in the almonds. Sprinkle chestnut Knödel with chestnut purée and serve with chocolate sauce and whipped cream. 

### Chocolate Sauce
Bring water to a boil with granulated sugar. Remove from heat. Stir in chocolate. Briefly blend with a hand blender briskly whisk with a wire whisk. Add rum and vanilla. Let cool slightly before serving. 

Yields 200 ml (⅞ c.). Half of this recipe is enough for the Chestnut Knödeln.
