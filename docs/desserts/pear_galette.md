## Ingredients

### Crust
<ul>
	<li>1½ c. all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>2 tbs. sugar</li>
	<li>½ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>11 tbs. (1 stick plus 3 tbs.) chilled, unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
	<li>5 tbs. (or more) buttermilk</li>
	<li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

### Filling
<ul>
	<li>6 tbs. (¾ stick) unsalted butter</li>
	<li>¾ cup packed golden brown sugar</li>
	<li>1 tbs. vanilla extract</li>
	<li>1 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
	<li>6 medium-size ripe Bartlett pears, peeled, halved, cored, each half cut into 3 wedges</li>
	<li>8 tbs. walnut pieces, toasted</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

### Crust
Combine flour, sugar, and salt in processor; blend 5 seconds. Add butter and process until butter is reduced to pea-size pieces. Add buttermilk and vanilla. Blend until moist clumps form, adding more buttermilk by teaspoonfuls if the dough is dry. Gather into a ball; flatten into a disk. Wrap; chill at least 1 hour (and up to 1 day).
Preheat oven to 425˚F. Roll out crust to 14-inch round; trim to 12½ -inch round. Chill while preparing the filling.

### Filling
Melt butter in heavy 12-inch nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon, and whisk until mixture is smooth and starts to bubble. Simmer until mixture thickens, whisking occasionally, about 4 minutes. Turn off heat.
Arrange pear wedges on their sides in two concentric circles in sugar mixture, crowding wedges to fit. Sprinkle with 6 tbs. walnuts. Cook over medium heat until pears are just tender, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Place crust atop pears in skillet; tuck crust edges in around pears. Cut several slits in crust for steam to escape.
Bake galette until crust is deep brown, about 38 minutes. Cool 5 minutes. Invert onto ovenproof platter. Rearrange any pears that have moved. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons walnuts.
(Can be made 4 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. If desired, re-warm in 350˚ oven 15 minutes before serving.)

Serve galette warm or at room temperature with ice cream.

Makes 10 servings.
