Preheat oven to 350˚F and grease 6 pudding molds. In a pan, bring the orange and lemon juices to a boil. Cook until liquid has been reduced to half. Cool. In a bowl, beat butter, sugar, and lemon zest until pale and creamy. Mix in egg yolks, one at a time. In a separate bowl, sift flour and baking powder together, then add to butter mixture. Slowly add juices and milk to mixture, stirring gently. In a large bowl, beat whites until they form soft peaks Beat ⅓ of whites into cake batter, then fold in remainder.

Stand molds in roasting tin and pour in batter, then pour boiling water into tin. Bake until golden brown and firm (20 minutes). Serve with liqueur shipped cream, orange peel, and mint.
