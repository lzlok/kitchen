## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>¾ c. + 1 tbs. whole milk</li>
	<li>¾ c. sugar</li>
	<li>3½ tbs. cornstarch</li>
	<li>3 large egg yolks</li>
	<li>5 tbs. fresh lemon juice</li>

	<li>5 large egg whites</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 400˚F. Coat six ¾ c. soufflé dishes with butter and sugar. Bring milk to simmer in medium saucepan over medium heat. Whist ¼ c. sugar, cornstarch, and yolks in bowl to blend. Gradually whisk in hot milk. Return mixture to saucepan; bring to simmer, whisking constantly. Remove from heat. Whisk in lemon juice and peel. Cool.

Beat whites to soft peaks. Gradually beat in remaining ½ c. sugar. Continue beating until stiff but not dry. Fold ¼ of whites into lemon mixture. Fold in remaining whites. Spoon mixture into prepared dishes, dividing equally. Bake until puffed and brown on top (18 minutes). DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN TO CHECK PROGRESS: SOUFFLÉ WILL DEFLATE.
