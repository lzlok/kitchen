## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>6 eggs, separated </li>
	<li>¾ c. (150 g) sugar </li>
	<li>1 c. (150 g) almonds, peeled & ground or 150 g almond flour </li>
	<li>85 g butter </li>
	<li>4 tbs. vanilla sugar with XXX powdered sugar </li>
	<li>1 tbs. cocoa </li>
	<li>⅓ c. (80 ml) milk </li>
	<li>2 tbs. rum </li>
	<li>1 c. (200 g) sugar </li>
	<li>7 oz (198 g) almonds, chopped</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

### Cake
Preheat an oven to 375˚C. Oil a 7-inch torte pan with 3-inch high sides. Line bottom with parchment, dusted with fine breadcrumbs.

Stand a mixing bowl over the bottom part of a double boiler filled with steaming water Beat the egg whites and 3⁄4 cup granulated sugar over steam until so stiff a spoon will stand in them. Remove from heat and mix in the ground almonds. 

Pour the mixture into the torte pan. Bake in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes. Cool the cake and cut into 2 layers. 

### Filling
Mix the egg yolks with the vanilla sugar and the powdered cocoa. Continue mixing and add milk and rum. Place the mixture over low heat and beat constantly until it starts simmering. Remove from heat. Cool. Whip the butter until foamy, and mix it into the egg yolk mixture. 

### Topping
Place 1 cup sugar in a heavy frying pan and pour in 7 oz chopped almonds. Let the sugar melt and lightly brown; then pour it on a marble or on a buttered cookie sheet and let it cool. Crush the candy like sheet in a mortar; the texture should be somewhat like that of uncooked rice. 

### Assembly
Spread some of the filling on one cake layer. Place the other layer on top, then use the rest of the filling to spread on the sides. Refrigerate the cake to make the outside surface firmer. Sprinkle the top and sides of the torte with the crushed almond caramel.
