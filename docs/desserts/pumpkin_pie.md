## Instructions
### Crust

Mix flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Incorporate butter and shortening as normal for crusts. Slowly add water until mixture is evenly moistened and very crumbly. It will not gather as a mass. Gather into a 5” disk, wrap, and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes.

Remove dough from refrigerator (let sit for 10 – 15 minutes if it was refrigerated for a long time). Roll into a 13” circle, adding flour as necessary. Transfer to 9” deep dish pie pan (should be at least 1½” deep) form to shape of pan. Freeze for 15+ minutes then bake at 375˚F using pie weights

After 20 minutes, remove the pie weights. Cover crust rim with foil so as not to burn. Bake for another 20 minutes until dry and golden. If bottom puffs, just push it back down gently.

### Filling

Whisk all filling ingredients together in a large bowl. Pour into pre-baked crust.

### Final Bake

Preheat oven to 325˚F. Bake filled pie for 50 – 60 minutes until the filling is just set. It should look dry around the edges, and the center should jiggle just slightly if you nudge the pan. Cover crust rum with foil if necessary. Cool to room temperature for a few hours before serving.
