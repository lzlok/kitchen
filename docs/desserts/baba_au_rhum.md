## Ingredients

### Baba Cakes
<ul>
	<li>7 grams yeast (1 sachet)</li>
	<li>⅓ c. milk</li>
	<li>1½ c. plus 2 tbs. flour, divided</li>
	<li>7 tbs. unsalted butter, softened</li>
	<li>2 tbs. sugar</li>
	<li>4 eggs</li>
	<li>¼ c. apricot jam, warmed and strained (optional)</li>
	<li>Whipped cream, to serve (optional)</li>
</ul>

### Rum Syrup
<ul>
	<li>1 c. sugar</li>
	<li>2 c. water</li>
	<li>¾ c. rum, additional rum for serving</li>
	<li>Peel of half an orange, pith removed</li>
	<li>1 vanilla bean or 1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

### Baba Cakes
Preheat the oven to 350 F. Butter the baba molds. 

In a large bowl, combine the yeast and milk. Set the bowl over a medium saucepot filled with an inch of simmering water. Stir the milk and yeast mixture to warm it slightly – it should be the faintest bit warm to the touch. Do not scald the milk. When the milk is warm, turn off the heat and remove the bowl from the saucepot and stir in ¼ c. sifted flour. Cover and set in a warm place for 20 minutes. 

Beat the butter with the sugar and 2 tbs. of flour. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat well. When the yeast dough has risen and becomes spongy, whisk in the butter mixture plus the remaining 1¼ c. flour to make a thick, dough-like batter. 

Spoon the batter into the greased baba molds and bake for 12-14 minutes for mini babas, 20-25 minutes for larger molds. The babas are done when they have risen and taken on a golden dome and have started to pull away from the sides of the mold slightly. 

### Rum Syrup
Split the vanilla bean in half, lengthwise. Scrape the seeds into a medium saucepan along with the pods and add the water and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and remove from heat. Stir in the orange peel and set the pot aside to cool. Add the ¾ c. rum. If using vanilla extract, add same time as rum.

While the babas are still warm, dip them in the syrup, leaving them in for a few minutes to saturate. Transfer the babas to a sheet pan (or wire rack placed over a sheet pan). When cool, brush the cakes with warmed, strained apricot jam (optional).

### To Serve
Split the babas lengthwise, spoon more rum syrup over the cakes as desired, and top with whipped cream. 

Makes approximately 25 mini babas, or 8 regular-size babas.

## Notes
<ul>
	<li>Make sure your eggs are at room temperature before you begin this recipe.</li>

</ul>
