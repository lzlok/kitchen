# Water-Proofed Bread
{: .no_toc }

---

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2 packages active dry yeast</li>
	<li>½ c. warm water (100˚ to 115˚ approximately)</li>
	<li>¼ c. plus 1 tsp. granulated sugar</li>
	<li>½ c. warm milk</li>
	<li>1 stick (½ c. butter)</li>
	<li>2 tsp. salt</li>
	<li>3 eggs</li>
	<li>3½ c. all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Rinse a 4-quart mixing bowl with warm water. Dry thoroughly. Put in the yeast, ½ c. warm water, and the teaspoon of sugar, and stir until the yeast dissolves. Allow it to proof for 5 minutes. Heat the milk with the butter and ¼ c. sugar until lukewarm, then add to the yeast mixture. Add the salt and stir to blend well. Add the eggs, one at a time, and again blend thoroughly. Then stir in 3 c. flour, a cup at a time, to make what will probably be a very wet and sticky dough. Stir quite vigorously. Spread out the dough on a working surface sprinkled with an additional ½ c. flour. Use a baker's scraper to work in this last portion of flour and make the dough firmer. Scrape under the flour and the dough, lifting and folding inward. Repeat until the flour is well incorporated.

When the dough is easy to handle, begin kneading by hand. Continue until the dough can be shaped. (The process of kneading first with the scraper and then by hand is very effective for delicate dough. In this case the dough will remain rather sticky, but don't worry about it.)

Lift the dough from the water, pat with flour, and place on a clean kitchen towel also sprinkled with flour. Wrap it and tie in the towel, just as you would a package, but very loosely. Submerge this in a large bowl filled with warm water (about 100˚ to 115˚). It will sink. Let sit for about 35 to 40 minutes, or until it rises sufficiently to float on top of the water.

Lift the dough from the water and let the excess water drip off. Unwrap and turn out on a lightly floured surface. Again it will be quite sticky, so scrape off any dough that adheres to the towel. Knead and shape into two loaves, using both dough scraper and your hands. Thoroughly butter two 9x5x3-inch pans and place one loaf in each pan. Cover, put in a warm, draft-free place, and let the dough rise slightly above the tops of the pans, or until almost doubled in bulk.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375˚. Brush the dough with cold water, and, if you like, make a slash in each loaf with a sharp knife. Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake for about 30 to 35 minutes, or until the loaves sound hollow when rapped with the knuckles, top and bottom. When done, pace the loaves directly on the oven rack, without their pans, to brown the bottoms a little more and crisp the crusts. Cool on racks.
