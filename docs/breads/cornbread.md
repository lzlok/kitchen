#### Mama's recipe from <i>Thrill of the Grill</i>
---

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>4 c. flour</li>
	<li>2 c. yellow cornmeal</li>
	<li>1½ c. sugar</li>
	<li>1 tsp. salt</li>
	<li>2 tbs. baking powder</li>
	<li>4 eggs</li>
	<li>3 c. milk</li>
	<li>2½ tbs. vegetable oil</li>
	<li>½ c. melted butter</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 350˚. Lightly oil a 12 x 2 x 8 inch pan.

Sift together flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, and baking
powder. In a separate bowl, mix together the eggs, milk, and vegetable oil.
Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients, then add the melted butter.
Stir until just mixed.

Bake for approximately 1 hour or until a cake tester comes
out clean. The cornbread should be brown on top when done.

Leftover cornbread can be made into croutons by cutting it
into small cubes and baking at 350˚F for 30-45 minutes, until brown and toasty.
Use for green salads.
