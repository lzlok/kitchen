## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1¾ c. (210g) flour</li>
	<li>1 c. (156g) yellow cornmeal</li>
	<li>¼ c. (50g) granulated sugar</li>
	<li>2 tsp. baking powder</li>
	<li>¼ tsp. baking soda</li>
	<li>½ to ¾ tsp. salt, to taste</li>
	<li>1¼ c. (283g) milk, lukewarm</li>
	<li>4 tbs. (57g) unsalted butter, melted, cooled</li>
	<li>¼ c. (50g) vegetable oil</li>
	<li>1 large egg</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 9" round pan or 12 muffin cups.

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

In another bowl, whisk together milk, melted butter, vegetable oil, and egg. Pour the liquid all at once into the flour mixture, stirring quickly and gently until just combined. Don't over mix: stir the batter just enough to bring it together and evenly moisten the ingredients. Spread the batter into the prepared pan.

Bake the bread for 20 to 25 minutes, until the edges just begin to pull away from the pan and a cake tester or paring knife inserted in the center comes out clean.

Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack for 5 minutes before cutting; serve warm.
