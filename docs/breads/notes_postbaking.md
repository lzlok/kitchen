## Cooling

<ul>
    <li>This last step is important! Unless the bread is overbaked, cooling sets the interior crumb. Cutting the bread before it has cooled will reveal a gummy interior.</li>
    <li>Cool on a wire rack so the bread doesn"t get soggy on the bottom.</li>
    <li>Flavor continues to develop in the bread until it is no longer hot.</li>
</ul>

## Storage

<ul>
    <li>Never store in the refrigerator: it speeds up starch retrogradation. Keep tightly wrapped at room temperature or freeze.</li>
    <li>To extend shelf life, store in air-tight bags in a cool, dark spot.</li>
    <li>Slice then freeze bread. Thaw slices as needed.</li>
    <li>Lean, crusty breads: To preserve crustiness, store in paper. With this method, the bread tends to turn stale within a day or two.</li>
    <li>Freezing and thawing</li>
    <ul>
        <li>If freezing loaves whole, allow 2 hours for thawing at room temperature before eating or warming.</li>
        <li>To accelerate the thawing process:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat oven to 400&deg;F.</li>
            <li>Place bread in a pan and cover with a towel that has been soaked in warm water and wrung out. Place in oven.</li>
            <li>Check on towel every 10 minutes and re-wet as necessary.</li>
            <li>A baguette should take 10 &mdash; 20 minutes to thaw. A standard-sized loaf should take 20 &mdash; 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>To restore a crispy crust, remove the towel and bake for a few minutes at 450&deg;F.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
