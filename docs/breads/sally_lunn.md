## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
	<li>⅓ c. sugar</li>
	<li>½ c. warm water</li>
	<li>½ c. lukewarm milk</li>
	<li>1 stick butter, melted in milk</li>
	<li>1 tsp. salt</li>
	<li>3 eggs</li>
	<li>3½ c. – 4 c. all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Combine yeast, sugar, and warm water in a mixing bowl and
allow to proof. Add milk, butter, and salt and stir well to combine. Add eggs
and incorporate well. Add flour in small amounts and beat well after each
addition. Make a stiff but workable batter, using up to four cups of flour if
necessary. Cover bowl and let batter rise until doubled.

Beat down with wooden spoon for about 1 minute. Scrape into
well-buttered 9 – 10” tube pan and let rise until batter reaches top of pan.
Bake at 375˚F for 40 – 50 minutes or until bread is dark and golden on top and
sounds hollow when rapped with your knuckles.
