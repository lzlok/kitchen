## Ingredients
### Dough
<ul>
	<li>1 c. warm milk (about 115 degrees F)</li>
	<li>2½ tsp. instant dry yeast</li>
	<li>2 large eggs at room temperature</li>
	<li>⅓ c. butter melted</li>
	<li>4½ c. all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>1 tsp. salt</li>
	<li>½ c. granulated sugar</li>
</ul>

### Filling
<ul>
	<li>½ c. butter almost melted</li>
	<li>1 c. packed brown sugar</li>
	<li>2 tbs. cinnamon</li>
	<li>½ c. heavy cream (for pouring over the risen rolls)</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
### Dough
Pour the warm milk in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle
the yeast overtop. Add the eggs, butter, salt and sugar. Add the flour and mix
using the beater blade just until the ingredients are barely combined. Allow
the mixture to rest for 5 minutes so the flour has time to soak up the liquids.

Scrape the dough off the beater blade and remove it. Attach
the dough hook. Beat the dough on medium speed for 5-7 minutes or until the
dough is elastic and smooth. The dough will be tacky and will still be sticking
to the sides of the bowl. That's ok! Don't be tempted to add more flour at this
point. 

Remove the dough from the mixer bowl and place it in the
greased large bowl. Cover the bowl with a towel or wax paper. Set in a warm
place and allow the dough to rise until double. It normally takes about 30
minutes for the dough to rise. Do not allow the dough to rise too much or your
cinnamon rolls will be airy. 

### Filling
While the dough is rising, prepare the cinnamon filling. In
a medium bowl, combine the soft butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, mixing until
well combined. Set aside.

### Assembly and Bake

Sprinkle a pastry mat generously with flour. Turn out the
dough onto the pastry mat and sprinkle the top of the dough with additional
flour. Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough to about a 12x15&quot; rectangle.
Use a rubber spatula to smooth the cinnamon filling over the whole dough
rectangle. Starting on the long end, roll the dough up tightly jelly roll
style. Cut into 12 slices and place in a greased 9x13 baking pan. Cover the pan
and allow the rolls to rise for 20 minutes or until nearly double. 

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 

Warm the heavy cream until the chill is off. Don't make it
hot...you just don't want it cold. It should be warm to the touch. 

Once the rolls have risen, pour the heavy cream over the top
of the rolls, allowing it to soak down in and around the rolls. 

Bake at 375 degrees for 17-19 minutes, until the rolls are
lightly golden brown and the center rolls are cooked through. 

Store in an airtight container.

Serves 12.
