	<li>103 g (¾ c.) bread flour [can just use all-purpose flour]</li>

## Instructions
Mix dry ingredients together. Slowly add butter, milk and then yolk.

Knead in mixer for 20 minutes on medium low until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Take a bit of dough and stretch it, you can see through it — kneaded enough. Dough should also be soft. Put in a 9x13 oiled baking dish. Cover and let rise for an hour at room temperature until almost doubled, then for 2 hours in refrigerator (can stay up to 24 hours).

Make filling while dough is in refrigerator. Mix all filling ingredients together with a mixer or with a spatula.

Invert baking dish with dough on a floured surface. Roll to 12x16 inches.

Spread filling on 12x16 rectangle, all the way to edges. Fold like a letter (in thirds) —fold the shorter edge— fold the top edge towards the center to a third of the rectangle then fold the bottom up towards the center Then roll again into 12x16 rectangle.

Even out the rectangle, if necessary by trimming the shorter edges (12 inch sides) with a pizza cutter to make the edge straight. Cut the 16 inch side into 16 strips (about 1 inch strips). Stretch the strips to 16 inches—To get the strip evenly stretched out, hold the ends a few inches above the table and then tap each strip against the table, swinging loosely/bouncing against the table while gently pulling the ends until it lengthens to 16 inches.

Hold the ends of the strip and twist in opposing directions to make a spiral. Hold one end between the thumb and index finger and wrap the strip around three fingers (index, middle and ring fingers) without losing the spiral, then tuck the second end into the center from underneath to form a turban-like knot.

Line 2 trays with parchment paper. Put 8 buns per tray, widely spaced apart. Let rise covered until doubled, about 40 minutes to 1 1⁄2 hour. When you touch the dough lightly and the impression stays, they’re ready to be baked. Buns should have risen more heightwise than sidewise.

Make the egg wash by beating the egg white with water. Brush each bun with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar. Bake one tray at a time in order to get a lacy edge of melted cardamom sugar. Bake 15-18 minutes, 400F oven. Cool completely or until warm. Don’t eat hot; you want to be able to lift the bun with its corresponding cardamom sugar circle. This cardamom sugar circle is characteristic of this bun.
