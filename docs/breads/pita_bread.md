## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2 packages yeast</li>
	<li>¼ tsp. granulated sugar</li>
	<li>2 c. warm water</li>
	<li>¼ c. olive oil</li>
	<li>1 tbs. salt</li>
	<li>6 c. hard-wheat flour</li>
	<li>Cornmeal</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Dissolve the yeast and sugar in ½ c. warm water in a large mixing bowl and allow to proof. Add the remaining 1½ c. water along with the oil, salt, and 5 c. flour, mixing vigorously, 1 cup at a time. (The dough will be rather sticky.) Turn out on a floured board and work in the remaining cup of flour or more if the dough is too sticky. Knead for a good 10 minutes or more until dough is smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball, place in a buttered bowl, and turn to coat with butter on all sides. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1½ – 2 hours, or until doubled.

Preheat oven to 500˚F. Put one of the baking sheets on the lowest rack of the oven for 5 minutes. Do not open the oven door until the 5 minutes are up. Transfer the sheet to a higher shelf and continue baking 3 – 5 minutes longer until the loaves are puffed like balloons and just very lightly browned. Repeat the procedure with the second baking sheet unless, of course, you have a large enough oven so that the baking sheets can go in side by side on the same shelf. Remove to prevent a crisp crust from forming and to ensure the familiar, spongy pita texture.
