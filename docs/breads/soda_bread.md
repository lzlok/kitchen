# Irish Soda Bread
{: .no_toc }

---

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>3 c. whole-wheat flour</li>
	<li>1 c. all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>1 tbs. salt</li>
	<li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
	<li>¾ tsp. double-acting baking powder</li>
	<li>1½ to 2 c. buttermilk</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Combine the dry ingredients and mix thoroughly to distribute the soda and baking powder, then add enough buttermilk to make a soft
dough, similar in quality to biscuit dough but firm enough to hold its shape. Knead on a
lightly floured board for 2 or 3 minutes, until quite smooth and velvety.

Form into a round loaf and place in a well-buttered 8-inch cake pan or on a well-buttered coke sheet. Cut a cross on the top of the loaf with a very sharp, floured knife. Bake in a preheated 375° oven is 35 to 40 minutes, or until
the loaf is nicely browned and sounds hollow when rapped with the knuckles. (The cross will have spread open, which is characteristic of soda bread.) Let the loaf cool before slicing very thin; soda bread must never be cut thick.

### Variation
For white soda bread, use 4 c. all-purpose flour, preferably un-bleached, and the same amounts of salt and baking powder called for in the master recipe, but decrease the baking soda to ¾ teaspoon. Otherwise, the bread is prepared in exactly the same way as in the master recipe.
