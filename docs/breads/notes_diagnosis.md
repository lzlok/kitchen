# Diagnosis
{: .no_toc }
---

<ul>
    <li>If you"re generally unsatisfied with your bread but don"t know where to start improving, consider the following</li>
    <ul>
        <li><i>Measurement</i>: Any error on the scale, especially for yeast or salt? </li>
        <li><i>Condition</i> of the pre-ferment when mixed into the final dough</li>
        <li><i>Flour</i>: new type of flour, new brand</li>
        <li><i>Folds</i>: quantity, timing</li>
        <li><i>Dough temperature</i>: upon mixing, during bulk rise </li>
        <li><i>Bulk fermentation</i>: rise time relative to rise volume</li>
        <li><i>Room temperature</i>: ambient temperature warmer or cooler than usual?</li>
        <li><i>Proofing</i>: underproofed or overproofed</li>
        <li><i>Dough strength and hydration</i>: dough feel (sticky/stiff), dough volume, amount of gas in dough</li>
        <li><i>Baking</i>: oven temperature, amount of steam, baking time</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## Problem: Flavor

<ul>
    <li>Smells overly yeasty: bread is overproofed or underbaked</li>
    <li>Not enough flavor</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough was too cold during rise for the given time.</li>
        <li>Dough needed a longer rise for the given temperature.</li>
        <li>Too much yeast prevented the dough from taking as long as it could to rise.</li>
        <li>Measure the dough temperature and note the rise times next time you make the recipe!</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Too sour sourdough flavor</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce the amount of whole grains. (Whole grains speed up fermentation and increase acetic acid production.)</li>
        <li>Perform the rises at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time.</li>
        <li>Add some commercial yeast to speed up the fermentation time, reducing the amount of time the bacteria have to produce acids. </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Measure the dough temperature and note the rise times next time you bake!</li>
</ul>

## Problem: Texture

<ul>
    <li>Too fine crumb / open and airy: add more liquid</li>
</ul>

## Problem: Shape

<ul>
    <li>Shredded along the sides: underproofed</li>
    <li>Uneven bloom: underproofed</li>
    <li>Flatter/smaller: overproofed and/or not enough tension surface after shaping</li>
    <li>Bubbles just under the crust: overproofed</li>
</ul>
