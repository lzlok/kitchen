## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2½ c. all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>12 tsp. salt</li>
	<li>¾ tsp. active dry yeast</li>
	<li>1 c. warm water (100˚ – 115˚)</li>
	<li>2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
	<li>2 tbs. rosemary</li>
	<li>3 tbs. olive oi</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Combine the flour, salt, yeast, and water in a mixing bowl.
Blend well, then turn onto a lightly flour board. Knead well, for about 15
minutes and shape the dough into a ball. Place it in a lightly greased mixing
bowl. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until double its size,
about 1 – 1½ hours.

Turn the dough onto the board and knead once more. Put it
back into the bowl and let rise again. Punch down the dough and turn it onto a
lightly floured board. Roll it out to ½” thickness. Rub the surface of a baking
sheet with oil. Transfer the round of dough to a baking sheet. Make
indentations over the surface of the dough and insert a thin sliver of garlic
and a bit of rosemary into each indentation. Pour the olive oil over the pizza
and rub gently. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and bake 15 minutes or until
golden brown at 400˚F. Remove the garlic before serving.

Serves 4 to 6. Makes 1 round loaf or perhaps 2 pizzas.
