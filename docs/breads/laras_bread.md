## Starter
### Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2 c. (454g) cool-ish water (90-100°F)</li>
	<li>1 tsp. active dry or instant yeast</li>
	<li>2½ c. (298g) bread flour</li>
	<li>½ c. (56g) whole wheat flour</li>
</ul>

### Instructions
Stir all of the starter ingredients together to make a thick, pudding-like mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 8 to 16 hours or until its rise peaks.

## Bread
### Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>All of the starter (above)</li>
	<li>½ tsp. active dry or 1 tsp. instant yeast</li>
	<li>50g whole wheat flour</li>
	<li>210g to 240g bread flour</li>
	<li>1½ to 2¼ tsp. salt, to taste</li>
</ul>

### Instructions
Stir down the starter with a spoon and add the water, yeast, whole wheat flour, 150g of the bread flour, and the salt. The dough will
be a loose, messy mass. Let it rest for 12 to 15 minutes, then stir it again;
it should become more cohesive and a bit smoother.

Knead the dough, adding up to an additional ¾ c. (90g) flour (as necessary to make a soft dough), 10 to 12 minutes.

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rise until almost doubled (1 to 2 hours).

Deflate the dough gently, but don't knock out all the air. For one large loaf, form the dough into a round ball; for two loaves, divide the dough in half and shape into two balls.

Place a semolina- or cornmeal-dusted piece of parchment paper onto a baking sheet. Gently place the ball(s) of dough on the baking sheet, seam-side down.

Cover the bread gently with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rise until it's puffy and about 40% to 50% larger, anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes.

Preheat your oven to 475°F.

Slash the bread with a sharp knife or lame. Dust it with a little flour. Spritz water into the oven, and place the bread in the oven. Reduce the heat to 425°F and spritz with water every few minutes for the first 15 minutes of baking.

Bake the bread for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until it's a rich golden brown, and its interior temperature registers at least 190°F on a digital thermometer. The smaller loaves will bake more quickly, so keep your eye on them.

### Notes

<ul>
	<li>For a more flavorful three-day long version of the bread: Mix half the starter in the evening of the first night. Put the starter in the refrigerator overnight then take it out in the morning.
	In the second evening, mix the remaining starter ingredients and bread ingredients. Fold roughly three times and immediately after the third fold, put in the fridge.
	At the beginning of the third evening, take out the bread from the fridge, fold, and let sit out until room temperature (roughly 2 hours). Bake as directed.</li>
</ul>
