## Oven Temperature

<ul>
    <li>Always preheat the oven 50&deg;F &mdash; 100&deg;F higher than necessary. Heat will inevitably be lost during door opening and steaming (see below). After loading and/or steaming the bread, lower the oven to the actual temperature.</li>
    <li>For convection ovens:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Lower the suggested temperature by 25&deg;F &mdash; 50&deg;F.</li>
        <li>Decrease baking time by 20%.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## Transferring the Bread

<ul>
    <li>From a banneton</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Invert the loaf onto a floured surface, using a hand to separate the loaf from the banneton if needed</li>
        <li>Manually pick up the bread and place it in the Dutch oven or on the pizza stone. Use the sides of your hand (not your fingertips) to distribute pressure when you pick up the delicate loaf.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## Steam

<ul>
    <li>Steaming is important to develop a good crust</li>
</ul>

### Method 1: Enclosed Bake (Dutch Oven)

1.	Preheat the Dutch oven on the middle rack of the oven for at least 30 minutes at 500&deg;F. The top part of the Dutch oven should be pre-heated open with both parts side-by-side instead of closed.
2.	Slide the bread onto the bottom piece of the Dutch oven using a peel.
3.	Cover the Dutch oven.
4.	After 15 &mdash; 20 minutes, reduce the temperature to 450&deg;F or 475&deg;F and remove the lid of the Dutch oven, opening the lid away from you to let the steam escape without scalding your face and arms. If the loaf is steamed well, it will be pale and shiny.
5.	Continue baking until done.

### Method 2: Open Bake (No Dutch Oven)

1.	Place an empty cast-iron pan on the bottom rack of the oven. Also preheat the baking stone if using.
2.	Preheat the oven at 500&deg;F for at least 30 minutes before baking, or 45 minutes if using a baking stone.
3.	Boil approximately 1 cup of water.
4.	Place the bread in the oven on its baking stone or other pan then immediately pour the boiling water into the empty cast iron. Close the oven door immediately.
5.	Lower the oven to the recipe-specified temperature and proceed as recipe instructs.

## Determining Done-ness

<ul>
    <li>The kitchen has started to smell of bread.</li>
    <li>The loaf is golden brown at minimum.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread with pre-ferments have a richer color (more starch has been converted to sugar).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The loaf feels lighter than it looks.</li>
    <li>The bread sounds hollow (generally only very experienced bakers can tell this way because the difference in sound between an underdone loaf and a done loaf is very subtle). </li>
    <li>Internal temperature</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Hard, crusty bread: 200&deg;F &mdash; 210&deg;F</li>
        <li>Soft bread (e.g., enriched dinner rolls, sandwich bread): 180&deg;F</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## Pizza Special: Baking Pizzas on a Pizza Stone

<ul>
    <li>Place the pizza stone in the upper third of the oven so that the stone is about 8" from the broiler.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to the highest setting possible (likely 500&deg;F) for 15 &mdash; 20 minutes after the oven reaches temperature.</li>
    <li>Switch the oven to broil for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Put the pizza in the oven and switch the oven to bake at 525&deg;F for 5 minutes.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooler oven = crispier crust with less moisture</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Switch the oven to broil for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the pizza.</li>
    <li>Fun fact: Neapolitan pizzas (which are super thin) are baked in a ~900&deg;F oven for only 90 seconds and have a lot of moisture!</li>
</ul>

## The Chemistry of Baking: Starch and Sugar

<ul>
    <li>Amylose starches burst between 180&deg;F and 212&deg;F, setting into a mass solid enough to cut</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread will never be baked with an internal temperature lower than 180&deg;F.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Sugar starts to caramelize at 325&deg;F</li>
    <ul>
        <li>White breads with little to no pre-ferment will turn a yellow-gold shade</li>
        <li>White breads with an extremely high portion of pre-ferment or ones that were retarded overnight in the refrigerator will turn reddish gold when done.  The enzymes in the bread released more of the maltose and glucose sugars trapped in the amylose starches. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
