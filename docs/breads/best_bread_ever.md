## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>500g flour</li>
	<li>10g or 2 tsp salt</li>
	<li>1 tsp. yeast</li>
	<li>315g water</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Put flour, salt, and yeast into food processor. Set a timer for 45 seconds. Start timer and food processor at the same time. Simultaneously, add water in a stream, leaving about 2 tbs. behind. The dough should stick together well. Add enough leftover water within the 45 seconds if necessary.

Let rise in metal bowl (not oiled) for 2 hours. Punch down. Rest 15 minutes. Shape. Let rise for 1 hour.

Put pizza stone in cold oven. Preheat oven to 500˚F. Allow the stone to stay in the oven about 15 minutes after reaching 500˚F and before putting baguettes in. When ready to put baguette in the oven, turn off the oven. Slide baguette onto pizza stone. Set oven to 450˚F.

Bake baguettes for 20-22 minutes.

<b>Note:</b> For a fluffier baguette, process for 20 seconds, rest 10 minutes, then process 25 seconds in the food processor step.
