#### From <i>Beard on Bread</i>

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>3 packages active dry yeast</li>
	<li>1 ⅓ c. warm water</li>
	<li>1 tbs. sugar</li>
	<li>1 tbs. salt (reduce)</li>
	<li>3 tbs. softened butter</li>
	<li>3 eggs</li>
	<li>5 – 5½ c. flour</li>
	<li>1 egg yolk mixed with 1 tsp. cold water</li>
	<li>Poppy seeds</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Proof the yeast in the lukewarm water in a large bowl. Add
the sugar, salt, butter, eggs, and flour (one cup at a time). Beat thoroughly
with a wooden spoon. Gradually add more flour until the dough is very stiff.

Knead on floured surface until smooth and elastic, 10
minutes. Place the dough in a very large, buttered bowl and turn to coat the
surface with butter. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until
doubled, 1½ – 2 hours.

Punch down and divide into 6 equal parts. Roll each portion into
a rope about 1” in diameter on a lightly floured board. Braid 3 ropes together
to make two loaves. Place the breads about 6” apart on a buttered baking sheet.
Cover and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled.

Brush the tops of the loaves with the egg wash and sprinkle
with poppy seeds. Bake at 400˚F for 35 – 45 minutes, or until loaves sound
hollow when tapped with the knuckles. Cool on racks.

Makes 2 braided loaves.
