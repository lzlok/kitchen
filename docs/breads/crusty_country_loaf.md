# Crusty Country Loaf
{: .no_toc }

---

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 pkg. active dry yeast</li>
	<li>1 tsp. sugar</li>
	<li>1¾ c. warm water</li>
	<li>5 c. (1lb 9 oz) country French, rustic white, or all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>1 tbs. salt</li>
	<li>Cornmeal</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Proof yeast and sugar in ¼ c. water. In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Add yeast mixture and rest of water, about 6 – 8 minutes. Knead until soft, silky, and elastic. Let rise until doubled, 45 – 60 minutes. Punch down, knead a few times, let rest for 5 minutes, then shape into a ball. Sprinkle base of cloche with cornmeal and place dough ball in center. Cover with lid and let rise 45 – 60 minutes until doubled.

Preheat oven to 450˚F. Sash the top of the loaf several times then put in preheated oven with cover for 15 minutes. Reduce oven to 400˚F and bake until bread is crusty, golden brown, and sounds hollow when tapped (about 30 – 40 minutes more). Remove the lid for the last 5 – 10 minutes of baking.
