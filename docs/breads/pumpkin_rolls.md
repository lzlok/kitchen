## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 tbs. plus ¾ tsp. dry yeast</li>
	<li>¼ c. warm water (105˚F to 115˚F)</li>
	<li>1 c. canned solid pack pumpkin</li>
	<li>1 c. warm milk (105˚F to 115˚F)</li>
	<li>¾ c. sugar</li>
	<li>2½ tbs. vegetable oil</li>
	<li>2¼ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>5¼ c. all purpose flour</li>
	<li>4 tbs. (½ stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Sprinkle yeast over warm water in small bowl; stir to
dissolve. Mix pumpkin, milk, sugar, 2½ tbs. oil and salt in heavy-duty mixer
fitted with dough hook. Blend in yeast mixture. Gradually beat in enough flour
1 cup at a time to form stiff dough. (Dough can also be mixed by hand.)
Continue beating until dough forms ball.

Lightly oil large bowl Add dough, turning to coat. Cover
bowl with plastic. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled, about
1½ hours.

Lightly grease 2 large cookie sheets. Punch dough down. Turn
dough out onto lightly floured surface. Divide into 3 pieces. Divide each piece
into 12 pieces. Cover with towel for 10 minutes.

Roll each dough piece into a smooth ball. Place 1 ball in
center of each prepared sheet; arrange 17 balls around each in concentric
circles with sides just touching. Cover rolls with towels and let rise in warm
draft-free area until doubled in volume, 45 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350˚F. Brush rolls lightly with 2 tbs.
butter. Bake until rolls are golden brown, about 30 minutes. Brush with
remaining melted butter. Serve rolls warm.

Makes 36 buns.
