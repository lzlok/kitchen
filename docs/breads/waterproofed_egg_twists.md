# Water-Proofed Egg Twists
{: .no_toc }

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
	<li>½ c. plus 1 tbs. granulated sugar</li>
	<li>½ c. warm water (100˚ to 115˚ approximately)</li>
	<li>3½ c. all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
	<li>1 tsp. salt</li>
	<li>1 stick (½ c. butter), cut into pieces</li>
	<li>¼ c. warm milk</li>
	<li>3 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
	<li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
	<li>½ c. chopped walnuts, filberts, or pecans</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Proof the yeast with 1 tbs. sugar in the warm water. Put 3 c. flour in a large mixing bowl and add the slat and butter. Rub the butter into the flour with your fingertips, working very quickly to keep the butter from melting, until the mixture resembles rather coarse meal. Add butter from melting, until the mixture resembles rather coarse meal. Ad the warm milk and the yeast mixture, and beat very well with a wooden spoon. Then add the eggs, vanilla, and one more cup of flour and beat until the batter is very springy and airy. Turn out on a lightly floured board and knead for just 1 minute, until you can form the dough into a ball.

Spread out a cotton or linen cloth — a kitchen tea towel is perfect — and put the dough in the center. Fold the towel over the dough as you would to wrap a package, keeping it rather loose. Secure the package with string, then submerge in a large bowl or crock of tepid water and let stand for about 35 to 40 minutes. The package will rise to the top and float. Remove and let the excess water drip off.

Unwrap the dough, which will have doubled in volume. Scrape off onto a lightly floured board, and shape into a ball, kneading in a little flour since the dough will be fairly wet and sticky at this point.

Pinch off from this ball of dough 18 or so even pieces about the size of a large egg. On a baking sheet or in a jelly-roll pan mix the ½ c. sugar and the chopped nuts. Roll each ball of dough in the sugar-and-nut mixture into a cylinder about 7 or 8 inches long. Fasten the ends together, and then twist at the center to roughly form a figure eight. Place on well-buttered baking sheets about 2 inches apart. Cover with aluminum foil and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot for about 30 to 40 minutes, until the twists are doubled in bulk. Bake in a preheated 375˚ oven 15 to 20 minutes, until golden in color and fairly hollow sounding when tapped on the bottom. Cool on racks.
