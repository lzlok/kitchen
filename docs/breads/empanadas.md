## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 onion, minced</li>
	<li>¼ green bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
	<li>1 pound extra-lean ground beef</li>
	<li>½ tsp. ground cumin</li>
	<li>¼ tsp. paprika</li>
	<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
	<li>3 tbs. olive oil</li>
	<li>½ c. water</li>
	<li>1 boiled egg, finely chopped</li>
	<li>10 pitted green olives, finely chopped</li>
	<li>2 (17-ounce) packages frozen puff pastry</li>
	<li>Flour, for dusting</li>
	<li>1 egg white</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

In a saucepan, sauté onions, green pepper, ground meat,
cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper in olive oil until lightly browned. Add water
and simmer covered for until meat is cooked through. Remove from heat and let
cool, then fold in the chopped boiled egg and olives.

Defrost puff pastry at room temperature and roll out on a
floured work surface. Cut pastry with either a fluted dough press or cookie
cutter to make 3½ -inch circles.

While holding 1 circle at a time in your hand, spoon 1 tsp. of
meat mixture into the middle. Fold pastry in half and secure the circle by
pressing the edges together with a fork to make a seal. Repeat with remaining
ingredients.

Place the empanadas on a well-buttered baking sheet and
brush the tops with egg white. Bake for about 20 minutes or until pastry is
well puffed and golden. Remove from the oven, let cool then serve.

Yields 8 to 12 servings.
