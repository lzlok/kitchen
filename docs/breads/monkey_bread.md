## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2 packages yeast</li>
	<li>1 c. sugar</li>
	<li>½ c. warm water</li>
	<li>2 sticks (1 c.) softened sweet butter</li>
	<li>½ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>1 c. warm milk</li>
	<li>3 eggs plus 2 egg yolks</li>
	<li>6 – 7 c. all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>½ c. brown sugar</li>
	<li>½ c. currants, pre-soaked</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Combine yeast, white sugar, and water in a large mixing
bowl. Proof. Separately, stir 1 stick of the butter and the salt into the warm
milk. (The butter does not need to melt completely.) Add to the yeast mixture.
Stir in the white eggs and egg yolks. Beat with a wooden spoon or with hands to
blend thoroughly. Add flour 1 cup at a time, stirring well. Continue adding
flour until dough is no longer sticky and can be kneaded. Knead by hand for 10
minutes until elastic and pliable. Let rise in a bowl until doubled. Punch down
and let rest for 5 minutes. Turn onto a lightly floured board and shape into a
ball. Let rest 5 – 10 minutes. Butter a 10” tube pan.

Melt the second stick of butter. Add the brown sugar and
currants. Pinch off enough dough to make golf ball-ball sized balls. Roll the
balls in the butter mixture and arrange in pan in loose layers. Pour any
remaining butter mixture on top of filled pan. Cover loosely with foil tent and
let dough rise to top.

Bake at 375˚F for about an hour. The bread will sound hollow
when tapped if it’s ready.
