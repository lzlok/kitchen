## Bringing the Dough Together

### Mixing

•	Avoid using the mixer at high speeds: the dough will be over-oxygenated and will lose flavor and texture.

### Autolyse

•	Mix together the flour, liquid, and any starter but not the salt or yeast. Let rest for 20 minutes to 40 minutes.
•	Do not add salt or yeast during this time. Salt prevents the flour from absorbing enough water!
•	Skip this step if half or more of the recipe’s total flour is in the pre-ferment. Most of the flour has already been autolyzed in the pre-ferment.
•	Why? Reduces kneading time
o	If using a mixer: requires 1 – 2 minutes of kneading.
•	Chemistry
o	Salt is hygroscopic, pulling water away from the flour instead of letting the flour hydrate.
o	Amylase enzymes bread down the complex carbohydrates in the flour into simple sugars for the yeast to feed on.
o	Protease enzymes degrade the gluten-forming proteins to make the dough more extensible (able to be stretched and hold shape without snapping back).


### Kneading

•	What to look for
o	The dough feels elastic and smooth.
o	It moves and expands as you push it like it has a life of its own.
o	If you grab a fistful, it will pull back instead of tearing immediately.
o	“Doorbell test”: If you push the dough lightly with a floured fingertip, it bounces back quickly.
o	“Windowpane test”: If you cut off a small piece of dough and pull it apart, it will stretch until it’s translucent rather than breaking.


#### Methods for Manual Mixing and Kneading

•	Wet your hand every so often to prevent the dough from sticking!
•	Incorporating salt and yeast in autolyzed dough
o	Mix the dough until it’s almost homogenous.
o	Keep the dough in the bowl.
o	Reach under the dough in the bowl and grab about a quarter of it.
o	Stretch it until the point of resistance.
o	Fold over the top to the other side of the dough.
o	Rotate the bowl a bit and repeat until finished kneading.
•	Initial stages of kneading
o	Kneading using the pincer method
1.	Perform on homogenous dough that is still in the mixing bowl.
2.	Squeeze big chunks of dough between your thumb and index finger until a chunk of dough breaks off.
3.	Repeat over the whole dough.
4.	Rotate the bowl and repeat whole process several times.
5.	Fold dough over.
6.	Repeat pincer method several more times until dough starts to have tension.
	This should take 2 to 6 minutes.
o	Bench scraper method
	Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board.
	Using a bench scraper, cut the dough into chunks roughly the size of a large lime (or smaller if you like!).
	Remix and fold the dough and repeat until it starts to have tension.
•	Optional: later stages of kneading (before bulk rise)
o	Use the fold method described below.


## Bulk Fermentation: The First Rise

•	Colder temperature = longer rise = more flavor
•	Aim for 78 – 82˚F ambient temperature to keep the dough at the ideal temperature.
•	For colder kitchens:
o	Use an insulated container to retain the dough’s heat.
o	Let rise in a pre-warmed oven or in a cold oven with a preheated pizza stone or a pot of boiling water.
•	Using folds to avoid kneading:
o	Mix the bread according to the mixing and autolyse instructions. Knead the dough only until it starts to have tension, but do not fully knead the dough.
o	For the first two hours of the rise time, perform a set of folds every so often using the technique and timing described below. You should work your way only once around the bowl for each set.
o	Once the dough starts to get very billowy and soft, perform the folds very gently to avoid pressing gas out of the dough.
•	A wet dough has finished rising and is ready to shape when it…
o	Is cohesive and releases from the sides of the bowl when you do the folds.
o	Has ridges that stay for a few minutes after folding.
o	Has a 20% - 30% increase in volume or tripled in volume depending on the recipe.
o	Has lots of air bubbles on the sides (visible if using a transparent container for the rise).
•	If you let it rise too long, give the dough a couple of folds and let it rise until it’s fluffy again.

### Folding

•	Builds strength with minimal effort.
•	Helpful in developing the structure of wet doughs.
•	Can be done in the bowl or on a lightly floured surface.
•	Steps
o	Pick up one corner of the dough with lightly floured hands.
o	Stretch it up (this builds the gluten structure) until you feel resistance, never until you tear it.
o	Fold it about two-thirds of the way across to the opposite corner.
o	Press down gently to de-gas the dough a bit.
o	Repeat with remaining three corners.
•	Timing
o	Perform the first fold roughly 10 minutes after mixing.
o	Perform the second fold roughly 30 minutes after the first fold or once the dough has completely relaxed from the previous fold.
o	Wetter doughs will need more folds, roughly 3 or 4 in the first hour or two.
o	Very slack doughs with shorter rise times max receive their last fold only an hour before shaping.
o	Do not fold the dough in the last hour of the bulk fermentation!
•	Chemistry: Gas buildup in dough makes it stronger as the gas expands and stretches the web within the gluten network. Folding captures and distributes this gas.


### Underproofing and Overproofing

•	Underproofed
o	Sign when baked
	Smaller loaf.
	Some portion(s) ripped open on the sides or top (i.e., the bread kept expanding after the crust set).
•	Overproofed
o	Sign when raw: the dough tends to collapse. Does not hold shape when shaped.
o	Sign when baked
	Flat, collapsed.
	Large bubbles just beneath the top crust.
	Tight, uniform crumb inside (if the bread was made from a very wet dough).
	Crust became golden faster, and the loaf has a dull color when done.
	Scores on loaf did not open well.
o	Slightly overproofed: bake immediately.
o	Truly overproofed: collapse the bread, reshape it, and proof it again.


## Forming the Bread

### Punching Down (Degassing)

•	Be gentle! Literally punching down dough removes the air and structure built during the bulk fermentation.
•	Why degas?
o	Expels carbon dioxide, which would otherwise choke off yeast.
o	Allows gluten to relax.
o	Equalizes temperature between the hotter inner dough and the cooler exterior.
o	Redistribution of nutrients for a new feeding cycle.
•	Breads that are supposed to have large airy holes should not be degassed.
o	Ciabatta should not be punched down and should be handled at a minimum.
•	Ken Forkish skips this step and does not degas any bread.


### Pre-Shaping

•	Gives structure to the dough to make it easier to shape.
•	Gluten tightens when you handle it, so rest the dough between pre-shaping and shaping.
•	Steps 
1.	Separate dough into pieces based on the number of loaves you are baking. Cut each piece cleanly rather than tearing to keep structure.
2.	Pull the edges of the dough up and into the center.
3.	Press down slightly in the center and pinch the edges together to create a loose round. For a baguette, pull the edges together in such a way that the bread forms somewhat of a rectangle.
4.	Bench rest:
	Rest the dough for 15 – 30 minutes or until it fights back when you stretch it. If you ended the bulk fermentation step early, give the loaves a longer bench rest.
	Doughs that are more resistant to shaping require longer bench rest. A baguette may require 2 – 3 bench rests to achieve the final length without significant degassing.
	Make sure the dough is guarded against cool drafts so it retains its internal heat and does not form a crust.
•	If the dough loses structure during the bench rest:
o	It rose for too long during the bulk fermentation
o	It did not rise for long enough during the bulk fermentation. If this is the case, re-shape it and repeat the bench rest.


### Shaping

•	All the following shaping instructions assume a pre-shaped dough.
•	Expect to remove some of the gas from the rise: this makes room for the yeast to continue to create new carbon dioxide as it bakes.
•	For shapes using any sort of mold:
o	Line the mold with a kitchen towel.
o	Lightly flour the towel with a 50/50 mixture of rice flour and wheat flour.
o	Place the bread seam side up.


#### Batard or Pan Loaf

For the bâtard, especially if not using a banneton, be sure to create a firmer shape; the extra surface tension associated with the firmer shape enables the loaf to rise upwards instead of outwards on its own.
1.	Stretch the pre-shaped dough out a big so that it forms a rectangle. Orient the rectangle vertically with the seam side of the pre-shape facing up.
2.	Fold the top edge of the dough about a third of the way down. Pat the loaf with the flat of your palm to knock out any large air bubbles.
3.	Fold the “shoulders” of the dough (the two folded corners) down to the seam you created with the first fold. The left and right shoulders may overlap some. The top of the dough will be roughly triangular at this point. Pat the folded section again.
4.	Fold the point of the triangle down to the seam. Seal it by pressing with the heal of your palm. Be careful not to flatten the dough.
5.	The top portion of the dough should now form a bit of a cylinder. Roll this cylinder towards you, sealing as you go. For the free form bâtard, gently press away from you as you roll to keep the tension in the dough.
6.	(Optional) For a free form bâtard with tapered ends, place your hands over the ends of the dough and roll out with a fair amount of downward pressure and a long rolling motion. Focus the pressure on the outsides of your hands.
7.	For a pan loaf, place into a greased pan seam side down


#### Boule

1.	Working around the pre-shaped dough, bring the edges to the center and pinch together.
2.	Flip over the dough seam side down on a flour-free surface.
3.	With your palms facing you and your pinkies on the work surface, cradle the dough. Slide the dough towards you in a long, decisive motion. The front edge should catch as the dough moves, tightening the side of the loaf and sealing the bottom seam. If the dough doesn’t catch, remove more flour from the work surface or wipe the bottom of the dough with a damp towel.
4.	Pick up the dough, rotate it a little keeping the seam side down, and place it farther away from you.
5.	Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have a nicely taut ball of dough.


#### Baguette

1.	Place the relaxed, pre-shaped dough on a lightly floured work surface with the good side down.
2.	Gently use the palm of your hand to flatten the piece into an oval shape of even thickness with the long sides in an east-west orientation.
3.	Fold one third of the dough toward you so it rests on itself. Gently pat out the air.
4.	Turn the dough around 180 degrees and again fold one-third of the dough toward you. Gently pat out the air. The dough should now be approximately rectangular and of even thickness.
5.	Starting with the right end of the loaf, begin to fold and press. The left thumb rests at the top of the dough with the fingers of the left hand holding the loaf from behind. The left-hand fingers pull the dough over the left hand thumb so that the dough covers the thumb. Use the heel of your right palm to seal the fold. Repeat down the entire length of the dough. The seam should be right, and there should be a ½” to ¾” lip of dough along the bottom length.
6.	Turn the dough 180˚ and repeat the folding and pressing process, this time bringing the seam right to the work surface. Again, the seam should be tight and approximately straight along the entire length.
7.	Turn the dough over so the seam is on the bottom. Place your right hand in the center of the dough, cupping it so your fingertips and heal of your hand touch the work surface. Roll the dough gently back and forth to slightly flatten the center of the dough.
8.	Place both hands side by side on top of the dough so that both index fingers are touching and the fingertips and heel of the palm touch the worksurface. Roll the dough back and forth to elongate it; your hands should slowly start to separate as you roll.
9.	When your hands have reached the ends of the dough, check the symmetry and proportions of the baguette. Refine the shape as necessary. The finished shape should have a high spot in the center and pointy ends.
10.	Let the baguette rises in a baguette pan lined with a floured linen couche until fully proofed.


#### Pizza

•	If making pizza, divide the dough so that each piece of dough will make one pizza (roughly 350g per portion) and pre-shape as a boule.
•	Skip the second shaping step: the pizza will be shaped after it proofs.


## Proofing: The Second Rise

•	Tartine’s expected rise time for their levain/sourdough bread 
o	75˚F – 80˚F for 2 hours for a mildly flavored loaf.
o	75˚F – 80˚F for 3 – 4 hours for a stronger flavor.
o	12+ hours in the refrigerator for the best flavor.
•	Every 17˚F difference in temperature effectively doubles or halves the proofing time.
•	What to look for
1.	“Doorbell test”: if you push the dough lightly with a floured fingertip, it leaves an indent then springs back slowly (2 to 3 seconds) and incompletely. If it springs back quickly, it needs more time. If the indentation remains without springing back, it’s overrisen.
2.	The dough feels marshmallow-y: light, gassy, and full of air.
3.	It’s fluffy without being fragile.
4.	May not be fully doubled.
5.	A collapsing dough will yield a dense, heavy bread.
•	If using the refrigerator:
o	Only recommended if the estimated rise time is 2+ hours. Doughs with a shorter rise time typically have more yeast. For these doughs, if rising in the fridge overnight, reduce the yeast slightly to prevent the dough from acquiring an overly yeasty flavor.
o	Leave the dough out at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes (but not longer) then refrigerate.
o	Judge when the rise is finished based on volume, not feel.
o	After 8 – 12 hours of refrigeration, doughs will develop more complex and mildly acidic flavors.
o	Can bake proofed loaves directly from the refrigerator.


### Pizza Special: If Making Pizza

•	Proof at room temperature for 30 – 60 minutes.
•	Then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (this makes the dough easier to shape without tearing).
•	Dough can be kept in the refrigerator up to two nights.


### Focaccia Special: If Making Focaccia

•	How to size dough balls for proofing:
o	200g pieces for ¼” thin crust focaccia baked in a 9-inch skillet.
o	250g pieces for thick-crust focaccia baked in a 9-inch skillet.
o	875g if baking on a sheet pan.
•	Oil the top of each ball of dough.
•	Cover with plastic wrap.
•	Proof at room temperature for 2 hours then refrigerate or bake. Or proof 1 hour longer than recommended proofing time for equivalent loaf bread recipe.
•	Focaccia can be baked overproofed since it is less important for it to expand and rise (and it’ll make the finger indents stay more easily)


## Scoring

•	Purpose:
o	Prevents cracking.
o	Good scoring enables an even rise.
•	Use quick decisive motions and the corner edge of the blade.
•	Angle straight blades perpendicular to the loaf.
•	Angle curved blades 30 degrees to the surface of the dough and use the corner of the blade.
•	Cut ¼” to ½” deep.
•	Consider using scissors for doughs with lots of add-ins (e.g., fruits, seeds) that prevent the lame from cutting easily.


## Pizza Special: Shaping the Pizza

1.	Lightly dust your pizza peel with the same flour you used to make your pizza dough. Don’t use cornmeal or coarse grains.
2.	Generously flour the work surface.
3.	Pat the chilled pizza dough down onto the flour.
4.	Turn over and repeat, leaving about 1 inch of the outer rim un-deflated.
5.	Again, flip the dough over and pat down, leaving about 1 inch of the outer rim un-deflated.
6.	With two hands, grab the rim at 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock and lift so the crust hangs down vertically. Place your thumbs about an inch from the perimeter to preserve the rim. Gravity will stretch down the dough.
7.	Run the rim between your hands, working all the way around the circumference of the dough several times.
o	Dust with flour as necessary during this process. Easiest done by plopping the dough down on an already-dusted work surface.
8.	Still working in the air, make two fists and position them just inside the rim with the crust still hanging vertically over your fists. Gently stretch and turn the dough repeatedly, still letting the bottom of the dough pull down to expand the surface.
9.	Work your way around the dough until the pizza is of even and desired thickness.
10.	Place dough on pizza peel.
11.	Run your hands around the perimeter of the dough to make it a circle.
12.	Give the pizza peel a test shake to ensure the dough hasn’t stuck.
13.	Add toppings to the pizza.
14.	Bake immediately.
