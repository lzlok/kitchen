## Instructions
Lightly grease a 10" square pan or 9" x 13" pan.

Mix the rum or apple juice with the dried fruit and raisins,
cover with plastic wrap, and microwave briefly, just till the fruit and liquid
are very warm, and the plastic starts to &quot;shrink wrap&quot; itself over
the top of the bowl. Set aside to cool to room temperature. (If you worry about
using plastic wrap in your microwave, simply cover the bowl with a glass lid.)

Optional: While fruit is cooling, follow the instructions in
Note 2. If short of time, proceed to next paragraph.

When the fruit is cool, mix together all of the dough
ingredients (including the eggs and the egg yolk from the separated egg); hold
out the fruit for the time being. Knead the mixture, using an electric mixer or
bread machine, until the dough is soft and elastic. It'll be very slack,
sticking to the bottom of the bowl and your hands as you work with it (greasing
your hands helps). Mix in the fruit and any liquid not absorbed. Let the dough
rise for 1 hour, covered. It should become puffy, though may not double in
bulk.

Divide the dough into billiard ball-sized pieces, about 3¾
ounces each. A heaped muffin scoop (about ⅓ cup) makes about the right portion.
You'll make 12 to 14 buns. Use your greased hands to round them into balls.
Arrange them in the prepared pan. Cover the pan, and let the buns rise for 1
hour, or until they've puffed up and are touching one another.

Preheat the oven to 375°F. Mix 75 g flour with enough water
to make a thick paste pipe onto risen buns. Bake the buns for 20 minutes, until
they're golden brown. Right before removing the buns from the oven, microwave
the apricot jab with a couple of tablespoons of water to make the jam slightly
running and “cook” the apricot flavor into the water without making it boil in
the microwave. Push the mixture through a sieve to remove any chunks. Remove the
buns from the oven and brush them with the apricot-water mixture. Carefully
turn the buns out of the pan (they should come out in one large piece). Transfer
them to a rack to cool.

<b>Note 1: </b>Home-made candied orange peel from about 4
oranges with candied lemon peel from 1 – 2 lemons worked very well.

<b>Note 2:</b> The <i>tangzhong</i> technique, a Japanese
method, increases the softness and shelf life of yeast rolls. Measure out the
flour and milk you’ll be using in the recipe. Take 3 tbs. of the measured flour
and ½ c. of the measured milk; put them in a saucepan set over medium-high
heat. Cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until it thickens and forms a
thick slurry; this will take about 1½ to 2½ minutes. Transfer the cooked
mixture to a bowl, let it cool to lukewarm, then combine it with the remaining
flour, milk, and other dough ingredients. Proceed with the recipe as directed.
Well-wrapped and stored at room temperature, your finished hot cross buns
should stay soft and fresh for several days.
