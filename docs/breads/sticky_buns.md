## Ingredients

<ul>
	<li>1 c. warm water (105°F to 115°F)</li>
	<li>4 tsp. dry yeast</li>
	<li>⅔ c. sugar</li>
	<li>½ c. (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
	<li>½ c. dry nonfat milk powder</li>
	<li>1¼ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>2 large eggs</li>
	<li>4¼ c. (or more) all-purpose flour</li>
</ul>

### Glaze
<ul>
	<li>1¼ c. (packed) golden brown sugar</li>
	<li>¾ c. (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
	<li>¼ c. honey</li>
	<li>¼ c. dark corn syrup</li>
	<li>¼ c. water</li>
	<li>2 c. pecan halves</li>
	<li>4 tsp. sugar</li>
	<li>4 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
### Dough
Mix ¼ c. warm water, yeast, and pinch of sugar in small
bowl. Let stand until foamy, about 8 minutes. Using electric mixer, beat
remaining sugar, butter, milk powder, and salt in large bowl until well
blended. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Mix in remaining ¾ c. warm water and yeast
mixture, then 3 c. flour, 1 cup at a time. Using rubber spatula, mix in 1 c. flour,
scraping down sides of bowl frequently (dough will be soft and sticky).
Sprinkle ¼ c. flour onto work surface and knead until smooth and elastic,
adding more flour if sticky, about 8 minutes. 

Butter another large bowl. Add dough; turn to coat. Cover
bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in warm area until doubled, about 2½
hours. 

### Glaze
Butter two 10-inch round cake pans with 2-inch high sides.
Beat brown sugar, ½ c. butter, honey, corn syrup, and ¼ c. water in medium bowl
to blend. Spread half of glaze in bottom of each prepared pan. Sprinkle 1 c. pecans
over each. 

Punch down dough. Divide dough in half. Roll each dough
piece out on floured work surface to 12x9-inch rectangle. Brush any excess
flour off dough. Spread remaining butter over dough rectangles, dividing
equally. Mix 4 tsp. sugar and cinnamon in small bowl. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar
over rectangles. Starting at 1 long side, tightly roll up each rectangle into
log. Cut each log into 12 rounds. Place 12 rounds, cut side down, in each
prepared pan, spacing evenly. Cover with plastic wrap. (Can be made 1 day
ahead; refrigerate.) Let buns rise in warm area until almost doubled, about 1
hour (or 1 hour 25 minutes if refrigerated). 

Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake buns until deep golden brown,
about 30 minutes. Run small knife around pan sides to loosen sticky buns. Turn
hot buns out onto platter. Cool about 30 minutes and serve. 

Makes 24 buns.
