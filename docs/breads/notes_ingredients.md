## Flour
	
<ul>
	<li>Handling higher protein flours</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Tend to require a mixer to activate the gluten network.</li>
		<li>Require higher hydration levels: they absorb more water.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>If you substitute flour for an alternative with higher protein, be sure to add more water.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Protein</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Good all-purpose flours have 11% - 12% protein and are ideal for European-style breads.</li>
		<li>Bread flours generally have ~14% protein.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Whole grains</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The bran in the whole wheat flour tends to cut into the gluten structure, resulting in denser breads.</li>
		<li>Store your whole grain flours in the freezer! The oil in the germ can go rancid at room temperature.</li>
		<li>If using unground whole grains, soften them by soaking in water for 8 to 16 hours or overnight to ensure a higher rise. Add the dough ingredients to your soaked grains, retaining the soaking water and reducing the water in the recipe by the amount of water that you used for soaking.</li>
		<li>How to handle whole grain flours</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Higher hydration (more water in the dough).</li>
			<li>A resting period to soften the bran (15 minutes before starting to knead).</li>
			<li>Addition of higher protein flours in the dough to stabilize the gluten structure.</li>
			<li>Use slightly less yeast or a shorter rise time since whole wheat flours have more active fermentation than all-white flour.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>General chemistry theory</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Flour contains two types of proteins: glutenin and gliadin which contribute to the dough's elasticity and strength.</li>
		<li>Liquid activates the proteins to form a gluten network.</li>
		<li>Mixing speeds up and strengthens the formation of the gluten network.</li>
		<li>More protein = more gluten network.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

### Specialty Types of Flours and Grains

<ul>
	<li>High Extraction Wheat Flour</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Freshly milled whole-grain flour passed through a fine-mesh sifter to remove the bran.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Spelt (triticum spelta)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Higher in protein and vitamins than common wheat.</li>
		<li>Does not work as well in super hydrated doughs (unclear why, just not recommended).</li>
		<li>Goes flat with longer rise times (acid breaks down this gluten very quickly).</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Einkorn (triticum monococcum)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Oldest cultivated wheat, ancestor to all other wheats.</li>
		<li>Tastes grassy and nutty.</li>
		<li>Has very delicate gluten.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Kamut (also called Khorasan)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Hard durum wheat found in Egypt, Turkey, and Italy but now also largely grown in Montana and North Dakota.</li>
		<li>Has 20% to 40% higher protein than modern wheats.</li>
		<li>Can be used to make both bread and pastry.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Rye</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Very low in gluten.</li>
		<li>Can be used to add tanginess to doughs, cookies, and cakes.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Buckwheat</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Has no gluten and therefore adds no structure to bread.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

### Sprouting Grains

<ul>
	<li>Why use sprouted grains?</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Adds a sweeter flavor to the dough.</li>
		<li>Makes dough easier to digest (e.g., dense rye breads like smorrebrod cannot be eaten in large quantity).</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Using sprouted grains in bread</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Typically 20% - 30% of total flour weight in dough.</li>
		<li>Add after the autolyze step, about an hour into the bulk rise once the dough already has developed a good structure. Incorporate gently.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>How to sprout grains</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Soak any gain (except buckwheat) with endosperm and germ intact in water for 4 to 6 hours. If sprouting buckwheat: wash grains 2 to 3 times. Soak for 20 minutes. On average, the dry berry weight increases by 65% after soaking and sprouting. </li>
		<li>Drain well.</li>
		<li>Stir and lift grains with hands to aerate. Grains need oxygen to sprout!</li>
		<li>Place drained sprouts in a container, cover with cheesecloth, and keep at room temperature.</li>
		<li>Rinse, drain, and aerate the grains every morning and evening, returning them to the container after each washing.</li>
		<li>Most grains take 2 to 4 days to sprout depending on the ambient temperature.</li>
		<li>The grains are ready to use when they have just sprouted but have not yet formed spider shoots.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Storage</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Refrigerate in an airtight container for a few days.</li>
		<li>Freeze for up to a week. Thaw in the refrigerator for a couple of days before use.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

## Liquid

<ul>
	<li>Impact of more liquid</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Faster ferment.</li>
		<li>A looser, more open gluten structure.</li>
		<li>Airier breads with large pockets and open crumb.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Chlorine content of water does not impact bread flavor because the chlorine will bake out of the bread!</li>
</ul>

## Yeast

<ul>
	<li>Use the bare minimum that gets the job done! You want the flavor to come from the flour, not the yeast.</li>
	<li>Types of yeast</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Fresh yeast</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Degrades after 2 weeks and relatively dead after 4 weeks.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Active yeast</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Always hydrate in warm water before incorporating into dough.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Instant yeast</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Can be mixed into dough dry if the dough is high hydration.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Pre-dissolve yeast in some water if dough is < 70% hydration. </li>
			</ul>
			<li>Recommend using 0.66% of flour weight.</li>
			<li>Proofing was often recommended to verify that the yeast is still alive and to disperse it evenly in the liquid. Modern instant yeast is reliably active and formulated to prevent clumping, rendering proofing unnecessary.</li>
			<li>SAF gold (osmotolerant yeast): special yeast for very sweet or very acidic doughs. Avoid for all other doughs.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Conversion between types of yeast, by weight: <br> 1g instant yeast = 1.2 to 1.5g active yeast = 3g fresh yeast</li>
	<li>Commercial yeast dies at temperatures as low as 114˚F.</li>
</ul>

## Salt

<ul>
	<li>Use table salt: it disperses and dissolves quickly and easily.</li>
	<li>Avoid iodized salt</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Inhibits fermentation.</li>
		<li>Tastes like iodine.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Purpose</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Gives flavor to breads.</li>
		<li>Usually around 2% of flour weight in yeasted breads.</li>
		<li>Tightens gluten structure: holds the carbon dioxide released by the yeast in the gluten structure, giving the bread volume.</li>
		<li>Slows fermentation. This ensures that your bread still has some rise left by the time it reaches the oven.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Chemistry theory: Salt causes the yeast to release some of its water. Since yeast needs more water to ferment faster, it is forced to ferment more slowly</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>When to incorporate</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Fine salt:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>When initially mixing the dough, reserve some of the water (e.g., 50g of water for 20g of salt).</li>
			<li>After the dough has rested but before the dough has been kneaded, dissolve the salt in the reserved water.</li>
			<li>Mix the salty water into the dough.</li>
			<li>Knead and proceed as usual.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Coarse sea salt: Add with all the flour when you start mixing the dough.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Weigh your salt! Variations in granule size make volume measurements wildly inconsistent, especially if the recipe does not specify the type of salt for the volume measurement.</li>
</ul>

## Butter

<ul>
	<li>Use unsalted butter. Salt content ranges considerably in salted butter, so you get more control by using unsalted butter.</li>
	<li>Role: adds tenderness and flavor.</li>
</ul>

## Sugar

<ul>
	<li>Dark v light brown sugar: darker sugar gives a denser texture in addition to a more molasses-y flavor.</li>
	<li>Role: adds tenderness, promotes browning, and extends the shelf life of the bread.</li>
	<li>Substitutions: swap sugar 1:1 by weight with honey or maple syrup in breads.</li>
</ul>

## Temperature

<ul>
	<li>Dough temperature</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Ideal: 78˚F</li>
		<li>Next best range of temperatures : 75˚ to 80˚F</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Tartine expects their sourdough bread to rise for 3 to 4 hours at ~80˚F.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Using cooler water that reduces the temperature of the dough by 1˚ - 2˚F results in a ~1.5h longer rise time.</li>
		<li>Mixing a 65˚F dough and leaving the dough in a 55˚ - 65˚F room will require an 8 to 12 hour rise.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Machine mixers add ~25˚F to the dough.</li>
	<li>It's hard to regulate room temperature, so regulate water temperature to achieve the ideal dough temperature. The temperatures below should result in a 2 to 4 hour bulk rise time.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Water temperature (if using a pre-ferment) = (4 x desired dough temperature) to (flour temperature + room temperature + pre-ferment temperature + friction factor)</li>
		<li>Water temperature (if no pre-ferment) = (3 x desired dough temperature) to (flour temperature + room temperature + friction factor)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Let's simplify the above equations:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Assume the flour and room temperatures are the same</li>
		<li>Assume a desired dough temperature of 76.5˚F</li>
		<li>Assume the use of a machine mixer adding 25˚F</li>
		<li>Water temperature (if using a pre-ferment) = 281˚F to (2 x room temperature + pre-ferment temperature)</li>
		<li>Water temperature (if no pre-ferment) = 205˚F to (2 x room temperature)</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

## Time

<ul>
	<li>More time = more flavor</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Use less yeast and a lower temperature to enable a longer rise time. </li>
	</ul>
</ul>
