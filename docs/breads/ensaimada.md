## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 small potato</li>
	<li>1 tsp. sugar</li>
	<li>1 c. warm water</li>
	<li>1 tbs. dry yeast</li>
	<li>1 c. flour, sifted</li>
	<li>1 c. butter, softened</li>
	<li>¾ c. sugar</li>
	<li>½ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>8 egg yolks</li>
	<li>4 c. flour, sifted</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

Boil potato until soft. Put into osterizer and blend with water to puree. Dissolve 1 tsp. sugar in mixture. Add yeast and let stand until softened. Add 1c. flour gradually until blended with potato. Cover with damp cloth and set aside in warm place for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

Cream butter and sugar thoroughly. Add salt and egg yolk, beating well after each addition. Add flour gradually, blending well. Add this mixture to the sponge yeast. Mix well. Put dough in a greased bowl and cover with damp cloth until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.

Divide dough into desired size. Roll out thinly. Sprinkle with cheese and roll into a finger-thin roll. Coil and place in ensaimada mold. Let rise for 2 - 3 hours. Bake in preheated oven at 400F for 10 minutes (though other recipes suggest 325F for 30-45 minutes).

Makes 18 to 24 pieces.
