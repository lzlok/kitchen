# French-Style Country Bread
{: .no_toc }
#### From King Arthur Flour
---

## Starter
### Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 c. (227g) cool-ish water (90-100°F)</li>
	<li>½ tsp. active dry or instant yeast</li>
	<li>1¼ c. (149g) bread flour</li>
	<li>¼ c. (28g) whole wheat flour</li>
</ul>

### Instructions
Stir all of the starter ingredients together to make a thick, pudding-like mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 2 hours. For best flavor, let the starter rest longer; overnight (up to 16 hours) is best. If you plan on making the dough in a bread machine, place the sponge ingredients in the bucket, and turn the machine on for just a few seconds to mix the ingredients together. Turn the machine off and close the cover, then let the starter rest as directed above.

## Bread
### Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>All of the starter (above)</li>
	<li>1 c. (227g) lukewarm water (100-115°F)</li>
	<li>¾ tsp. active dry or ½ tsp. instant yeast</li>
	<li>1 tbs. (14g) sugar</li>
	<li>80g whole wheat flour</li>
	<li>360g to 390g bread flour</li>
	<li>1½ to 2¼ tsp. salt, to taste</li>
</ul>

### Instructions
Stir down the starter with a spoon and add the water, yeast,
sugar, whole wheat flour, 300g of the bread flour, and the salt. The dough will
be a loose, messy mass. Let it rest for 12 to 15 minutes, then stir it again;
it should become more cohesive and a bit smoother.

Knead the dough, adding up to an additional ¾ c. (90g) flour (as necessary to make a soft dough), 10 to 12 minutes.

Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rise until almost doubled (1 to 2 hours).

Deflate the dough gently, but don't knock out all the air. For one large loaf, form the dough into a round ball; for two loaves, divide the dough in half and shape into two balls.

Place a semolina- or cornmeal-dusted piece of parchment paper onto a baking sheet. Gently place the ball(s) of dough on the baking sheet, seam-side down.

Cover the bread gently with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rise until it's puffy and about 40% to 50% larger, anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes.

Preheat your oven to 475°F.

Slash the bread with a sharp knife or lame. Dust it with a little flour. Spritz water into the oven, and place the bread in the oven. Reduce the heat to 425°F and spritz with water every few minutes for the first 15 minutes of baking.

Bake the bread for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until it's a rich golden brown, and its interior temperature registers at least 190°F on a digital thermometer. The smaller loaves will bake more quickly, so keep your eye on them.
