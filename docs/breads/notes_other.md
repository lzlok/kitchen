## Tangzhong Method

<ul>
    <li>Used to extend shelf life so bread stays fresh for three days.</li>
    <li>More common in enriched doughs (cinnamon rolls, hot cross buns, etc.).</li>
    <li>Ingredients</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole milk, 42% of total required amount</li>
        <li>8 grams of bread flour per 40ml of milk (higher protein flour absorbs more liquid without diluting the structure of the gluten strands)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Method</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Combine milk and flour in a saucepan, whisking until no clumps remain.</li>
        <li>Cook mixture over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture is thick and paste-like (whisk should leave lines on the bottom of the pan). This takes one to three minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and transfer to the bowl of a mixture. Use immediately.</li>
        <li>Add remaining dough ingredients starting with the remaining whole milk and flour to cool the paste so that it does not scald the yeast.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## Adding Grains: The Porridge Method

<ul>
    <li>Per 100g of total flour weight in the bread, use ~50g of porridge.</li>
    <li>Best in breads with up to 75% hydration (75g of water per 100g of flour) before the porridge is added.</li>
    <li>Use any grains that are cracked, rolled, or flaked.</li>
    <li>Method</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Combine 2 parts of water with 1 part of grain by weight in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until the grains soften and become creamy.</li>
        <li>Season with salt.</li>
        <li>To cool before use, spread in a thin layer on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Store in fridge if desired but bring back to room temperature before mixing into bread.</li>
        <li>Add porridge to bread about 1 hour into the bulk rise then proceed with the bread as usual.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Optional pre-ferment</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Instead of the first step in the method:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Dissolve 1 tsp of young leaven or live culture yogurt in 500g of water.</li>
            <li>Add 250g of grains and mix.</li>
            <li>Leave out at cool room temperature overnight.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Instead of leaven and 500g of water, you can use 500g of fresh whey.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>As a rule of thumb, the weight of the resulting porridge is 65% heavier than the dry weight of the grain used.</li>
</ul>

## Adding Grains: Another Method

<ul>
    <li>Per 100g of total flour weight in the bread, use ~50g of soaked and fermented cracked gain.</li>
    <li>Method</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Prepare the grains</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Flaked grains: coarsely chop in food processor.</li>
            <li>Whole-grain berries: coarsely crack in a home grain mill or powerful blender.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Sift grains</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Reserve the finer flour to coat the exterior of the bread before baking.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Soak coarsely chopped or cracked grains in water </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Oats: use a 3:1 ratio by weight.</li>
            <li>All other grains: use a 2:1 ratio by weight.</li>
            <li>Optional additional pre-ferment</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Substitute the water for fresh whey.</li>
    <li>OR add 1 tsp of young leaven or live culture yogurt to the water.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Cover and let sit for 1 &mdash; 2 days at room temperature, stirring each day.</li>
        <li>Leave until there is mild souring and grains have absorbed most of the water.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Tartine looks for a bear-like aroma if fermenting cracked rye this way. This usually takes 3 days.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Strain off excess liquid.</li>
        <li>Soaked and drained grains can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Bring back to room temperature before use.</li>
        <li>Incorporate into the bread after the first two series of turns, about 1 hour into the bulk rise then proceed with bread process as usual.</li>
</ul>

## Adapting Recipes

<ul>
    <li>Always weigh all ingredients when modifying recipes.</li>
    <li>Always take notes on any new quantities and processes so you can improve on the adapted recipe the next time.</li>
</ul>

### Changing Flour Blends

<ul>
    <li>Converting white flour to whole wheat flour</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Plan to add more water because whole wheat flour absorbs more water than white flours.</li>
        <li>Try increasing water in increments of 3% of the whole wheat flour weight.</li>
        <li>Record the weight of the water you used so you know how to change it next time!</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

### Changing Hydration

<ul>
    <li>Don"t change the hydration of any preferments, just reduce the amount of water in the final dough!</li>
    <li>Increase hydration &rarr; plan to perform an extra fold or three during the bulk rise.</li>
</ul>

### Converting to a Pre-Ferment

<ul>
    <li>Generally use 20% to 30% of total weight of flour in recipe for pre-ferment.</li>
    <li>Total amount of all ingredients used in recipe remain the same whether using a preferment or not: when adding the remaining recipe ingredients to the pre-ferment, subtract the quantity of flour, water, yeast, and salt used in the pre-ferment from the total quantities listed in the recipe.</li>
    <li>Example 1:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>You start with a recipe which has 600g of bread flour and 450g of water without pre-ferment. Instead, you make a biga which contains 150g of flour, and 100g of water, and 0.5g of yeast. Then, when mixing the final dough, you combine the biga with 450g of flour, 350g of water, and the remaining ingredients.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Example 2:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Your recipe uses a biga with 150g of flour, 100g of water, and 0.75g of yeast but you want to see how it tastes with a poolish. Instead, you mix your poolish with 150g of flour (always keep the flour the same), 161g of water, and 0.4g of yeast. When you mix your final dough, add the original amount of flour, the original amount of water less 61g, and the 0.35g more than the original amount of yeast. At the end of the day, you should have used the same total quantities of flour, water, yeast, and salt but just changed the timing of when you incorporated them.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

### Adjusting the Schedule

<ul>
    <li>ATTENTION: If you let the bread rise in the fridge, only do that for either the bulk fermentation or the proofing but never both rises!</li>
    <li>Example: Stretch the bulk fermentation from 5 hours to 8 hours (if you"re busy during the day) by using only two-thirds of the yeast and keeping the temperature the same.</li>
    <li>Example: You get busy and need to extend the proofing for another hour. 50 &mdash; 60 minutes after shaping the loaves, put them in the fridge to finish proofing. Bake cold instead of letting them come up to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Example: The dough is unbelievably slow to rise.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Option 1: Put the dough in the (unheated) oven with the door just barely ajar to keep the light on. This warms up the oven.</li>
        <li>Option 2: Put the dough in the (unheated) oven with a pot of warm/hot water. Use a thermometer to monitor the dough temperature to make sure it doesn"t get too hot.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

### Turning a Loaf Recipe into Pizza or Focaccia

<ul>
    <li>Pizza</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce hydration: total water weight should be 65% &mdash; 70% of total flour weight.</li>
        <li>Use softer flours such as all-purpose or Italian 00 flour for a more delicate texture.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Focaccia</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Increase hydration: total water weight should be ~80% of total flour weight. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
