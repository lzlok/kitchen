	<li>⅓ c. (74g) cool water</li>

	<li>2¼ c. (269g) all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>¼ c. (57g) lukewarm water</li>
	<li>2 large eggs</li>
	<li>4 tbs. (57g) butter, softened</li>
	<li>½ tsp. Fiori di Sicilia flavoring<br>
OR 1 tsp. vanilla + ⅛ tsp. orange oil</li>
	<li>2¼ tsp. SAF Gold instant yeast or 1 tbs. instant yeast</li>
	<li>1¼ tsp. (8g) salt</li>
	<li>⅓ c. (67g) sugar</li>
	<li>½ c. (85g) golden raisins</li>
	<li>½ c. (64g) slivered dried apricots</li>
	<li>½ c. (85g) dried cranberries</li>
	<li>½ c. (71g) chopped dried pineapple</li>
	<li>2 tbs. grated orange rind or grated lemon rind (zest)</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
###Starter (the night before):

Combine the starter ingredients in a medium-sized mixing
bowl, cover, and allow them to rest overnight (8 to 12 hours).

### Dough:

Combine all the dough ingredients except the fruit and zest,
and mix and knead them together until the dough is soft and smooth. Rise,
covered, for 1 – 1½ hours, or until it's puffy (though not necessarily doubled
in bulk).

Gently deflate the dough, and knead in the fruits and zest. Shape
the dough into a ball and place it in a panettone pan or other straight-sided,
tall 1½- to 2-quart pan. Cover the pan and let the dough rise until it's just
crested over the rim of the pan, about 1 hour.

Bake the bread in a preheated 400°F oven for 10 minutes;
reduce the oven heat to 375°F and bake an additional 10 minutes; then reduce
the heat to 350°F and bake for 25 to 35 minutes, tenting with aluminum foil if
the crust appears to be browning too quickly. Panettone should be a deep brown
when done, should sound hollow when tapped, and will read 190°F at the center
using a digital thermometer. (It's easy to underbake, since it browns so
quickly!)

Remove the panettone from the oven and cool completely.
