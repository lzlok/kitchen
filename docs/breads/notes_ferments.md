## Sourdough Starter
	
### Making from Scratch

•	Tartine and King Arthur Flour method.
o	Day 1: Mix 75g each of water and flour. King Arthur Flour recommends covering and leaving the mixture at room temperature for 24h. Tartine recommends covering and leaving in a cool shaded spot for 2-4 days or until bubbles have formed around the sides and on the surface; there may be a crust, and the starter will smell strong like sharply acidic, stinky cheese. Ken Forkish recommends leaving the mixture uncovered for 1 – 2 hours then covering and letting rest in a warm place (75˚F – 90˚F).
o	Day 2: Discard all but 50g of the mixture. Stir in 50g each of water and unbleached all-purpose flour. Cover and leave at room temperature for 24 hours. Do not use this discard.
o	Day 3: You may start to see some activity. Every 12 hours, discard all but 50g of starter and add 50g each of unbleached all-purpose flour and water. Continue this for 14 days. Sometime between Day 7 to Day 10, your starter will acquire the taste of an unripe starter, and you will start to be able to use the discard in recipes that don’t require starter for leavening.
o	Day 14: Your starter should be ripe and ready to use as leavening.
•	Flour Water Salt Yeast method
o	Day 1: Mix 80g each of 90˚F water and whole wheat flour. Leave the mixture uncovered for 1 – 2 hours then cover and let rest in a warm place (75˚F – 90˚F).
o	Day 2: Discard all but 40g of the mixture. Stir in 80g each of 90˚F water and whole wheat flour. Leave the mixture uncovered for 1 – 2 hours then cover and let rest in a warm place (75˚F – 90˚F). By the end of the day, there should be some small bubbles visible from the side of the glass jar.
o	Day 3: Starter should be bubbly with a leathery alcohol smell. Repeat process from Day 2. By the end of the day, the starter should have a pungent, “sour porridge” odor.
o	Day 4: Discard all but 50g of the starter. Add 125g each of 90˚F water and whole wheat flour. Mix until just incorporated. Cover and let rest in a warm place.
o	Day 5: Culture should be vigorous enough to use in breads. Switch to regular maintenance feeding schedule.


### Storing

•	Glass jars make it easy to see how active the starter is.
•	The starter should have a cover that is not airtight.
o	Using a towel to cover or no cover at all makes the starter dry up.
o	An airtight cover causes pressure to build up during fermentation.
•	Can store at room temperature and feed daily (recommended for frequent baking).
•	Can store in the refrigerator (recommended for less frequent baking).
o	Method 1: Store in the refrigerator in a non-airtight container and feed weekly using feeding instructions below.
o	Method 2: Add a thin film of water over starter. Wrap in a non-perforated plastic bag. Refrigerate for up to 1 month without feeding.
•	Never freeze: it kills the starter.


### Feeding

•	Time the feeding so that it occurs at the peak of the starter’s rise (i.e., when it has risen 2.5x for a ripe starter), not after it declines from peak ripeness.
•	If maintaining at room temperature
o	Plan to feed the starter roughly every 12 hours.
o	Retain 50g of starter at every feeding.
o	If the kitchen is over 85˚F, keep the starter in the refrigerator to prevent it from ripening too fast.
•	Ken Forkish’s recipe for feeding once per day
o	50g starter (or up to 65 – 75g of starter in the winter when it’s colder)
o	50g of whole wheat flour
o	200g of white flour
o	200g of water, 85˚F – 90˚F depending on the ambient temperature (use cooler water if the room is warmer)
o	Feed every 22 to 26 hours.
•	If maintaining in the refrigerator
o	Plan to feed once a week.
o	Retain 50g of starter at every feeding and use a 1:1:1 weight ratio of starter, flour, and water.
o	After feeding, allow the starter to ferment at room temperature until it begins to show signs of activity (little bubbles) then put the starter back in the fridge. This might Take an hour or two or a whole day depending on the room and water temperature and the amount of life in the starter.
•	Reviving dormant starter
o	If there is liquid on top, stir it back into the culture.
o	Feed at room temperature twice a day using a 1:1:1 ratio and retaining 50g of starter for each feed.
•	Using different flours for feeding
o	Bakers often use cheap flour due to the high quantity of discard.
o	Whole grain flours can make the starter too acidic for the yeast and must be used with care. (Whole grains speed up fermentation for both yeast and bacteria.) If using, reduce the hydration of the starter slightly to slow down fermentation.
•	Maintaining a milder starter flavor
o	Feed more times per day.
o	Retain a smaller percentage of starter.


### How to Tell Ripeness for Baking

•	The starter more than doubles in size within 6 to 8 hours of feeding.
•	Bubbles rise to the top and pop.
•	The starter has just barely started to recede.
•	There are rivulets on top that are maybe a bit foamy.
•	Fresh, tangy aroma. “Medium-ripe pungency.”
•	If you reach in and scoop it with your hand, you feel a web-like internal structure.


### How to Tell if Your Starter is Dead

•	Dead: pink or red color, signs of mold growth, smells putrid (rather than sharply acidic or strongly fermented)
•	Struggling but salvageable: covered in clear but dark liquid, no bubbles, sharp aroma.


### Starter Discard

•	Importance of discarding starter
o	Yeast is sensitive to excessive acidity. Discarding a portion of the starter ensures that the mixture will not be too acidic.
•	What to do with discard
o	Ideas: pancakes, cinnamon buns, banana bread, muffins, biscuits, crackers.
o	Converting a recipe to use discard starter
	Know the flour to water ratio in your discard.
	Ensure the total weight of flour and liquid in the modified recipe is the same as the quantity in the original recipe.
	Substitute 25% – 30% of the weight of the flour in the recipe with flour from the discard.
	Example: No-discard recipe includes 170g of flour and 340g of milk. Choose to use 120g of flour + 100g of discard + 310g of milk. Since the 100g of discard has 50g of flour and 50g of water in it, the original quantities of flour and liquid have been maintained.

### Stiff Cultures

•	Traditionally just a bit of dough saved from yesterday’s baking but can be approximated by a lower hydration starter.
•	How to make:
o	Take regular 100% hydration starter.
o	Use 70% hydration (or 70g water for every 100g flour and 100g starter).
o	Feed every 12 hours as usual.
o	After a few days, the lactobacilli will have established themselves in the new, lower-hydration environment, and the starter will be ready to use.
o	The starter is ready for use when it rises 3.5-4 times its initial volume in 6 – 8 hours.


### Does Starter Origin Matter? No!

•	What doesn’t matter in a starter’s flavor or performance?
o	Starter age (e.g., 100 years).
o	Location (e.g., the bakery on this one particular mountain in the Pyrenees).
o	The local air.
o	How the starter was stared (e.g., with grapes).
•	What matters?
o	How the starter is made (ratios, timing).
o	Ingredients used (e.g., which flour).
•	You can leave your starter at home, travel anywhere, and follow your regular procedure to make a new starter from scratch that replicates your original starter!


## Making a Levain

•	Levain = sourdough starter that has been prepared for baking (i.e., fed recently and pampered)
•	For a starter coming from the refrigerator:
o	A relatively alive, weekly fed starter need only be taken out from the fridge a day or two before baking.
o	A poorly fed starter may need to be taken out of the fridge 3 – 5 days before baking.
o	Once the starter is taken out of the refrigerator, feed it twice a day every 12 hours until it doubles in 6 to 8 hours then proceed to the next bullet.
•	For the last feed before baking:
o	Begin with an actively ripe starter at room temperature.
o	Feed 6 to 12 hours before baking so that the starter will be ripe but not overripe when you mix the bread dough.
o	Feed quantity:
			<li>Suppose you want _d_ grams of starter to go into your bread dough.
	Assume you want to retain 50g of starter for future bakes.
	Assume you plan to feed the starter in a 1:1:1 ratio for your last bake.
	$ Starter required for last feeding = /frac{d + 50}{3} $
	If the starter required for your last feeding is more than you have, use the equation below to find the quantity of starter you need to use for your first of n feeds before you bake. After this feed, do not discard any starter and always follow a 1:1:1 feed ratio. Play with different values of _n_ until the starter required for this is less than or equal to the amount of starter you have on hand. After _n_ feeds, your starter will be enough to use for baking.
			<ul>
				<li>$ starter required to ramp for baking = /frac{d + 50}{3^{n}}$
			</ul>
	Impact of temperature on feed ratio: Use a larger amount of starter relative to flour and water in colder climates (and vice versa for warmer climates).
•	The levain is ready to be mixed into the bread dough when it
o	Is sweet in an overripe-fruit sort of way.
o	Floats if you drop a spoonful of it in a bowl of moderate room-temperature water.
•	What happens if I skip making the levain and use ripe-ish starter instead? The bread risks having a more alcoholic, fermented taste, and it may not rise as well.
•	Factors that impact levain flavor
o	Quantity of acetic acid (vinegary flavor) and lactic acid (milky/buttery flavor)
	Chemistry: Levain is a culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast. Lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid but under certain conditions produce acetic acid.
o	Temperature of water used when the culture is fed
	Cooler levain (55˚F – 65˚F)  more acetic 
	Warmer levain (78˚F – 90˚F)  more lactic
o	Type of flour
	High-extraction flours, whole grain wheat or rye flours, and high-ash flours (which have a high mineral content)  more vigorous fermentation  more frequent feedings required 
	Salt can be added to the levain to slow the fermentation process to fit into your schedule.
o	Starter feed ratio
	Stiffer levain (lower hydration)  more acetic
	Equal parts levain, flour, and water  more lactic, less acetic
o	How ripe the levain is
o	How much levain is used in the final dough

## Determining a Pre-Ferment Done-ness

•	Looser pre-ferments: lots of small fermentation bubbles, noticeably pleasant aroma with a perceptible tang.
o	Specifically in a poolish: slight doming, liquid separation, crevasses on the surface.
•	Stiffer pre-ferments: just beginning to recede in the center (rise has peaked).
