## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>80g yeast</li>
	<li>1 kg (~6 c.) flour</li>
	<li>170 ml milk</li>
	<li>750 g butter</li>
	<li>400g sugar</li>
	<li>1 tbs. salt</li>
	<li>Peel of 2 lemons, grated</li>
	<li>600g raisins</li>
	<li>100g almonds,</li>
	<li>75g candied orange peel</li>
	<li>75g candied lemon peel</li>
	<li>120 ml rum</li>
	<li>6 packs vanilla sugar</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
### The Evening Before

To warm rum, add the dried fruit, almonds, and grated lemon
peel in a bowl. Mix and cover.

### Baking Day

Mix yeast in a large bowl with some milk (not more than
30˚C) and some sugar. Sprinkle with flour. Leave for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, sift the flour onto a work surface. Sprinkle
flakes of butter on it, 150g of sugar and salt. Add the yeast mixture. Then
chop everything into crumbs with a large knife. Knead for at least 20 minutes,
adding the milk bit by bit. The dough must lose its greasy appearance and must
not stick anymore. Add the fruits, preferably kneading only for a short while.
Let sit covered for only 30 minutes.

Knead thoroughly again. Break into pieces of the desired
size and shape into rolls. 

Form into a long loaf: with the side of the hand, form a
long, deep groove such that one side is approximately double the width of the
other. Fold the larger side over the smaller one. Line a baking sheet with
aluminum foil and baking paper. Place the Stollen on the sheet and cover. Let
sit for 20 – 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 220˚C (430˚F). Top heating is
better than convection. For a 500g Stollen, bake ~45 minutes. For a 1kg
Stollen, bake ~60 minutes. Regularly check it in the oven. If it becomes brown,
cover with foil.

### After Baking

Immediately after baking, brush with melted butter. Let the
Stollen cool completely. Then brush with melted butter again. Mix sugar with vanilla
sugar then sprinkle all around the Stollen using a sifter. Then, sprinkle the
Stollen with powdered sugar on all sides.

### Tips:

<ul>
	<li>Bake and cool approximately 3 weeks before consumption.</li>
	<li>Use only the very best ingredients. Use only unsulphured raisins, lemon peel, and
orange peel and dice them yourself.</li>
	<li>Use butter and not margarine! Do not use any chemical vanilla sugar, especially
bourbon vanilla sugar. It is better to scrape out the pods and mix with sugar.
Use good rum.</li>
	<li>One should make the effort to knead the dough by hand instead of with a machine.
The warmth of your hands will make it simply better.</li>
	<li>The fruit should be incorporated quickly/briefly otherwise the dough will become
unsightly. I first flatten the dough then distribute the fruit on it. I cut the
dough into pieces (corresponding to the number of Stollen you want to make) and
roll the dough pieces individually with the fruit, pressing the dough more as I
knead it.</li>
	<li>In order to prevent the Stollen from spreading too wide in the oven as it bakes, I
form the Stollen higher than it is wide. One can also use a Stollen baking pan,
which makes the Stollen look like it was machine-made (store bought).</li>
	<li>On the raisin problem. The raisins at the dough surface will swell, becoming black
and bitter. If one removes them after baking, the Stollen will look like the
surface of the moon. To prevent this, I press all the raisins with a dull spoon
stem far into the dough (a hole will be left after each raisin) and pinch the
holes closed. That way the Stollen will be properly formed and there will be no
more burned raisins.</li>
	<li>The baking temperature must be very high, otherwise the dough will be greasy and
hard to digest. In order that the Stollen doesn’t get burned, I put baking
paper under the aluminum foil and cover it with foil after 20 minutes of baking
time (a large piece can be covered with an oven cloth on the Stollenform baking
pan).</li>
	<li>The Stollen should be brushed with butter when hot then brushed again when it
cools. This seals the surface so that the Stollen can keep for months.</li>
</ul>
