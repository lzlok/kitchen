#### From <i>Beard on Bread</i>

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2 packages active dry yeast</li>
	<li>Brown sugar</li>
	<li>½ c. warm water (100˚ to 115˚ approximately)</li>
	<li>½ c. melted butter</li>
	<li>2 whole eggs plus 3 egg yolks</li>
	<li>1 tsp. salt</li>
	<li>4 - 4½ c. all purpose flour</li>
</ul>

### Glaze
<ul>
	<li>1 egg yolk</li>
	<li>2 tsp. flour</li>
	<li>2 tsp. sugar</li>
	<li>2 tsp. water</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Dissolve the yeast and ½ c. brown sugar in warm water in a mixing bowl and allow to proof. Stir in the melted butter, whole eggs, egg yolks, and salt and blend well. Add the flour, 1 cup at a time, beating it in with a wooden spoon or with the hand. Turn the dough out on a floured board and knead with additional flour until you have a soft, velvety, elastic dough with no trace of stickiness. (A good 5 minutes of concentrated kneading should accomplish this.)

Divide the dough into equal portions. Flatten and shape each into a round loaf. Place on a greased baking sheet, cover with a tent of aluminum foil, and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours. Brush the egg mixture over the tops of the two loaves and slash once or twice with a sharp knife or razor blade. Sprinkle with additional sugar, if desired, and bake in a preheated 325˚ oven 35 to 40 minutes, or until the bread sounds hollow when tappen on top and bottom with the knuckles. Cool on a rack before slicing.
