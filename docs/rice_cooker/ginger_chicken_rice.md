## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 large chicken bouillon cube, preferably all-natural</li>
	<li>3/4 cup hot water</li>
	<li>1 cup jasmine rice</li>
	<li>1 1/4 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
	<li>One 2-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and cut into matchsticks</li>
	<li>3 packed cups baby spinach</li>
	<li>1 cup unsweetened coconut milk</li>
	<li>Kosher salt </li>
</ul>

## Instructions
In a small bowl, dissolve the bouillon cube in the hot water. In a rice cooker, combine 
the rice with the chicken and ginger. Arrange the spinach on top. Pour the coconut milk 
and bouillon broth into the cooker and season lightly with salt. Turn the cooker on; the 
dish should be done in about 40 minutes (when the cooker turns itself off). Let stand for 
5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork, spoon into bowls and serve.

Serves 4.
