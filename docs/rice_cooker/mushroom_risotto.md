<b>Note:</b> This recipe requires brief use of a frying pan to saute onions, garlic, mushrooms, and pepper. 
If the rice cooker is hot enough, before cooking the rice, you can saute these four ingredients in the rice cooker, following the order and timing in the original recipe. 
Then you can add rice and and proceed to cook, following the remaining instructions in the recipe.

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 1/2 c. Arborio rice, rinsed and drained well</li>
    <li>2 tbs. olive oil</li>
    <li>3 to 3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
    <li>1/2 c. finely chopped onion</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>8 oz. mushrooms, cleaned and sliced</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. pepper</li>
    <li>2 tbs. butter</li>
    <li>2 tbs. chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>1/2 c. grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Place the rinsed and drained rice in the bowl of a rice cooker. Drizzle with 1 tbs. of the 
olive oil and stir to coat well. Add 2 1/2 cups of broth and the salt. Stir well.

Close the lid of the rice cooker and press the "Cook" button. Cook for 20 minutes, then 
switch to the "Keep Warm" setting.

While the rice is cooking, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large, 
heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 5 minutes.
Add the garlic and saute, stirring continuously, for another minute or two. Add the mushrooms and pepper. 
Cook, stirring continuously, until the mushrooms are juicy and tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove 
the skillet from the heat. Taste and, if necessary, add salt and additional pepper, to taste. Set aside.

After switching the rice cooker to the "Keep Warm" setting, carefully open the lid and stir 
in the sauteed mushrooms, and additional 1/2 cup of the broth, the butter, parsley, and 
Parmesan cheese. The mixture should have a creamy consistency; but, if it does not, stir in 
up to another 1/2 cup of the broth. Continue stirring for about 1 minute longer; then, taste 
and adjust the seasonings again, if necessary. Serve with additional Parmesan cheese for garnish, if desired.

Serves 6.
