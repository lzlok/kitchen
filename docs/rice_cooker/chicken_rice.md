## Ingredients
### Chicken:
<ul>
	<li>8 chicken drumsticks or boneless chicken thighs</li>
	<li>1 tsp Shaoxing rice wine</li>
	<li>1 pinch white pepper</li>
	<li>¾ tsp salt</li>
	<li>1 stalk scallions, finely chopped</li>
	<li>1 tsp minced ginger</li>
</ul>

### Rice:
<ul>
	<li>280 g jasmine rice, 1 ½ cup</li>
	<li>1 ½ tbsp cooking oil</li>
	<li>2 stalk scallions, finely chopped</li>
	<li>1 tsp minced ginger</li>
	<li>1 carrot, diced</li>
	<li>1 pinch salt</li>
	<li>530 ml water, 2 ¼ cup, see note 3</li>
</ul>

### Sauce:
<ul>
	<li>3 tsp light soy sauce</li>
	<li>1 tsp black rice vinegar</li>
	<li>1 tsp fresh chilli, finely chopped, optional</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
### Chicken:
Use kitchen scissors to debone the drumsticks: cut around the knuckle. Insert scissors 
under the flesh and cut along the bone, trimming any remaining flesh. Marinate chicken 
pieces with Shaoxing rice wine, white pepper, salt, scallions and ginger. Leave to rest 
for at least 10 minutes.

### Rice:
Rinse rice under cold water. Soak for about 10 mins then drain.

Heat up oil in a pot (or a deep frying pan). Fry scallions and ginger until fragrant. 
Spoon half out into a small bowl for making the sauce later. Add rice, carrot and salt. 
Stir fry for a minute then transfer to rice cooker (or just put everything straight into 
a rice cooker without cooking). Place chicken pieces on top (Avoid overlapping). 
Set rice cooker to cook until the chicken is done.  
    
### Serving:
While waiting, prepare the sauce. Add light soy sauce, black rice vinegar and chilli to 
the bowl which holds the fried scallions and ginger. (If you skipped sautéing previously, 
saute half of the scallions and ginger now) Mix well. When cooked, put the rice 
then the chicken into serving bowls. Top with the sauce. Serve immediately. If desired,
serve with blanched bok choy.

Serves 4.
