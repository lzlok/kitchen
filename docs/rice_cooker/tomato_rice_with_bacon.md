## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2 rice cooker cups of rice</li>
	<li>1 medium-sized tomato</li>
	<li>150g bacon bits, optionally pre-fried</li>
	<li>2 eggs, cooked separately</li>
	<li>1/2 c. frozen corn</li>
	<li>8 tiger prawns, peeled and deveined</li>
	<li>1/2 c. chopped broccoli</li>
	<li>1 chicken broth cube (or you can use chicken broth instead of water)</li>
	<li>2 tsp. butter</li>
	<li>black pepper</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Add rice to the rice cooker and water up to the 2 cup mark. Scoop out 1/4 c. + 2 tbs. water from the rice cooker so your rice will not get soggy as the tomato will release its juices.

Remove the stem of the tomato. Place the hole tomato on top of the rice. Crumble the chicken cube over the rice.
Add butter, corn, and broccoli. Season with black pepper. Add the raw bacon bits, or reserve them to fry later as desired. Cook the rice like normal.

If frying the bacon, fry the bacon.

Scramble the eggs using the bacon fat to cook if desired.

Blanch the prawns in slightly sated water for 1-2 minutes until just cooked.

When the rice is done, use the rice scoop to cut through the tomato and mix all the toppings in the rice cooker. Serve.
