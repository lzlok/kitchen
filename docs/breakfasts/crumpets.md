# Crumpets
{: .no_toc }
---

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>209 g flour</li>
	<li>½ c. milk, lukewarm</li>
	<li>⅓ c. water, lukewarm</li>
	<li>½ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>1¼ tsp yeast</li>
	<li>⅓ c. water</li>
	<li>⅓ to ½ tsp. baking soda</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Beat the first five ingredients together to form a stiff dough. Let it rest for one hour.

Add the ⅓ c. water and baking soda. Let rest 30 minutes until frothy.

Lightly grease the griddle or frying pan and place well-greased 3¾” English muffin rings in the pan, as many as will fit. (If you don’t have English muffin rings, use well-cleaned tuna cans from which you’ve removed the top and bottom.) Pour sticky batter by the scant ¼ cupful into each ring.

After about 4 minutes, use a pair of tongs to slip the rings off. Cook the crumpets for a total of about 10 minutes on the first side, until their tops are riddled with small bubbles/holes. They should be starting to look a bit dry around the edges. Their bottoms will be a mottled, light-golden brown.

Turn the crumpets over and cook for an additional 5 minutes to finish cooking the insides and to brown the tops gently. This isn’t traditional: “real” crumpets are white on top, but this ensures that the crumpets will be properly cooked.

Serve warm or cool completely, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature. To enjoy, warm in the toaster. Serve with butter and jam.

Yields approximately 10 crumpets.
