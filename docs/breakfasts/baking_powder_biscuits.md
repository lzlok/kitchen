# Baking Powder Biscuits
{: .no_toc }

---

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2 c. sifted all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>1 tbs. baking powder</li>
	<li>½ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>¼ c. butter</li>
	<li>¾ c. milk</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a mixing bowl. Blend butter into flour to form very fine particles. Add milk and stir into dough just enough to make particles cling together. (It should be a very, very soft dough.) Knead for about 1 minute then shape into biscuits. For high, fluffy biscuits, dough should be ½ – ¾” tick. For thin, crusty biscuits, dough should be ¼” thick. Bake at 450˚F for 12 – 15 minutes.

Makes approximately 12 biscuits.
