## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 medium onion, diced (optional)</li>
	<li>1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced (optional)</li>
	<li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
	<li>2 tsp paprika</li>
	<li>1 tsp cumin</li>
	<li>1/4 tsp chili powder</li>
	<li>1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes (or use the same amount of fresh tomatoes)</li>
	<li>6 large eggs</li>
	<li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
	<li>1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)</li>
	<li>1 small bunch fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

Heat olive oil in a large saut√© pan. Add the chopped bell pepper and onion and cook for 
5 minutes or until the onion becomes translucent. Add garlic and spices and cook an additional minute.

Pour the can of tomatoes and juice into the pan and break down the tomatoes using a large 
spoon. Season with salt and pepper and bring the sauce to a simmer.

Crack the eggs onto the tomato mixture. (If using more than four eggs, crack half the eggs 
into one bowl and half the egs into another bowl, then pour the eggs from the two bowls 
simultaneously, spreading them out if possible. This will prevent the eggs cracked first
from cooking too much). Cover the pan and cook for 5-8 minutes, or until the eggs are 
done to your liking. Garnish with chopped cilantro and parsley.

Serve with bread
