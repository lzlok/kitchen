# King Arthur Scones
{: .no_toc }
---

## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2¾ c. (326g) flour</li>
	<li>⅓ c. (67g) sugar</li>
	<li>¾ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>1 tbs. baking powder</li>
	<li>8 tbs. (113g) butter, cold</li>
	<li>1 – 2 c. chopped dried fruit, chocolate or other flavored chips, nuts, etc. (optional)</li>
	<li>2 large eggs</li>
	<li>2 tsp. vanilla extract or the flavoring, of your choice</li>
	<li>½ – ⅔ c. (113 – 152g) half-and-half or milk</li>
	<li>2 tsp. milk (for topping)</li>
	<li>2 tbs. sparkling sugar (for topping)</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar,
salt, and baking powder. Work in the butter just until the mixture is unevenly
crumbly; it's OK for some larger chunks of butter to remain unincorporated.
Stir in the fruit, chips, and/or nuts, if using them.

In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, vanilla,
and half-and-half or milk. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients
and mix until everything holds together. 

Line a baking sheet with parchment (or use the sheet
ungreased). Sprinkle some flour atop the parchment or pan. Scrape the dough
onto the floured parchment or pan, and divide it in half. Round each half into
a 5&quot; circle (if you haven't incorporated any add-ins); or a 6&quot; circle
(if you've added fruit, nuts, etc.). The circles should be about ¾” thick.

Brush each circle with milk, and sprinkle with coarse white
sparkling sugar or cinnamon-sugar. Using a knife that you've run under cold
water, slice each circle into 6 wedges. Move the wedges to have ½” space
between them.

For best texture and highest rise, place the pan of scones
in the freezer for 30 minutes, uncovered. They can be kept in the freezer for
up to 1 month. Chilling the scones relaxes the gluten in the flour, which makes
the scones more tender and allows them to rise higher. It also chills the fat,
which will make the scones a bit flakier. While the scones are chilling,
preheat the oven to 425°F.

Bake in the upper third of your oven for 18 – 23 minutes
until light golden brown.

Makes 12 scones.

## Note
To make free-form (drop) scones rather than wedge-shaped scones, increase the
half-and-half or milk to ¾ c. (171g). Dollop the scone dough in ⅓-cupfuls onto
a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake the scones in a
preheated 375°F oven for about 30 minutes.
## Variations
### Savory Scones
For savory scones, reduce the sugar to 2 tbs. and omit the vanilla. Add 1 to 2 c.
of savory add-ins, like fresh or dried herbs, crumbled bacon, etc., right after
you've worked in the butter, and before adding the liquid.
