	<li>1 tsp. baking powder</li>
	<li>½ tsp. baking soda</li>
	<li>¼ tsp. salt</li>
	<li>2 large eggs</li>
	<li>¾ c. sour cream</li>
	<li>¾ c. whole milk</li>
	<li>¼ c. vegetable oil</li>
	<li>½ tsp. vanilla extract</li>

### Maple Pecan Butter
<ul>
	<li>½ c. (1 stick) unsalted European-style butter, room temperature</li>
	<li>2 tbs. honey</li>
	<li>Generous pinch of ground cinnamon</li>

## Instructions
### Pancakes
Sift flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into large bowl. Whisk eggs in medium bowl to blend; whisk in sour cream, milk, oil, and vanilla. Gradually add liquid mixture to dry ingredients, whisking just until blended.

Heat griddle or heavy large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, brush griddle lightly with melted butter. Pour batter by ⅓ cupfuls onto griddle. Cook until bottoms brown, about 4 minutes. Turn pancakes over and cook until second sides brown, about 2 minutes. Divide pancakes among plates and top with honey-pecan butter. Serve, passing warm maple syrup separately.

### Maple Pecan Butter
Using electric mixer, beat butter, honey, and cinnamon in small bowl until fluffy. Stir in pecans. Season with salt.
