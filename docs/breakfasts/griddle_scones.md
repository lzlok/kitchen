</ul>

## Instructions
Sift flour, cream of tartar, salt, sugar, and baking soda together. Take a cupful of the mixture and combine it with enough buttermilk or sour cream to make a soft dough. Pat it with the hand on a floured board and form into a circle ½” thick. Cut in wedges and bake on a floured griddle over medium heat until lightly browned, then turn to brown the other side.
