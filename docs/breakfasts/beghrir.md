## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1½ c. fine semolina or durum flour<\li>
	<li>¾ c. all-purpose flour<\li>
	<li>1 tbs. dry yeast<\li>
	<li>2 tsp. baking powder<\li>
	<li>1 tsp. sugar<\li>
	<li>1 tsp. salt<\li>
	<li>3 c. + 2 tbs. lukewarm water</li>
</ul>

## Instructions

Use a blender or food processor to combine all ingredients to yield a smooth batter the consistency of crepe batter. Transfer the batter to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap to rest for 10 – 15 minutes, or until the batter appears light and foamy with lots of tiny bubbles.

Heat a crepe pan over medium heat. When hot, stir the beghrir batter, then slowly pour some batter into the center of the pan, allowing it to spread outward into a circle on its own. Cook the pancake without turning until set with no wet spots (1 – 2 minutes). The pancake should feel spongy to the touch, and no batter should stick to your finger.

Be sure to cool the beghrir in a single layer before stacking them, otherwise they'll stick.

Makes 16 5" beghrir. 

### Notes
<ul>
	<li>Serve with honey, syrup (made from butter and honey), butter, or jam<\li>
	<li>Leftovers will keep for two days at room temperature when wrapped in plastic or frozen for up to two or three months. Be sure to separate pancakes to avoid sticking. <\li>
	<li>If the bubbles don't form properly, the batter may be slightly thick. Thin with water and let rest before attempting another pancake.<\li>
	<li>You can use all semolina or durum flour: replace the white flour with an equal amount of the semolina or durum<\li>
	<li>Beghrir are usually cooked only on one side. However, in some regions the cooks will flip them over briefly; in that case they might be called khringos.<\li>
