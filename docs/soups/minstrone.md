	<li>~1 lb. beef short ribs</li>
	<li>2 qt. water</li>
	<li>2 large ripe tomatoes or 2 tbs. tomatoes paste</li>
	<li>2 carrots, peeled</li>
	<li>2 stalks of celery, diced</li>
	<li>1 c. fresh green beans, cut into ½” pieces</li>

	<li>2 medium potatoes</li>
	<li>1 tsp. oregano</li>
	<li>10 leaves fresh basil (optional)</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Remove as much of the fat from the meat as possible, but don’t discard the bones. Boil water and add the meat. Peel and seed tomatoes then add to pot. Add to water. Dice carrots into ½” large pieces and add to pot. Chop beans and add with celery to pot. Add peas, greens, zucchini, and whole peeled potatoes. Simmer covered for 1 hour.

Season and add oregano, then simmer for another hour.

Remove meat. Discard bones and grisle, cut meat into bite-sized pieces, then return to soup. If potatoes aren’t disintegrated, mash them in broth. Add basil and half the cheese. If too sweet from carrots and tomatoes, add 1 tbs. of wine vinegar. Simmer a few minutes longer. Serve with remaining cheese.

If prepared in advance, let sit but don’t refrigerate.

Serves 6 people.
