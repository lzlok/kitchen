## Instructions
Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions, bell pepper, garlic, chili powder, cumin, coriander, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are softened and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.

Increase the heat to medium-high and add half the beef. Cook, breaking up the chunks until no longer pink and just beginning to brown, 3 – 4 minutes. Add the remaining beef and cook, breaking up chunks until no longer pink, 3 – 4 minutes.

Add the beans, tomatoes, tomato purée, and ½ tsp. salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covered, and stirring occasionally (if the chili begins to stick to the bottom of the pot, stir in 12 c. water and continue to simmer) until the beef is tender and the chili is dark, rich, and slightly thickened. Adjust the seasonings with salt to taste. Serve with the lime wedges and toppings.

Serves 8 to 10.
