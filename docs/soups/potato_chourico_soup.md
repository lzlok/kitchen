## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>¼ c. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
	<li>2 medium onions, diced</li>
	<li>2 – 3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
	<li>6 – 8 oz. spicy, dried Portuguese chouriço or Spanish chorizo, cut into ¼” dice, can be obtained at <a href = "https://www.yelp.com/biz/fernandes-fish-market-cambridge" target = "blank">Fernandez Fish Market</a></li>
	<li>2 lbs. waxy potatoes (e.g., white or creamer), peeled and cut into chunks</li>
	<li>1 bay leaf</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>6 oz. (half a bunch) Tuscan kale, stems remove</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350˚F. Put olive oil in a soup pot on medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring, until soft, about 5 min Stir in the garlic and cook for 2 more minutes, then add half the sausage, potatoes, bay leaf, and 4 c. water. Bring to a boil, then boil on reduced heat until the potatoes are soft, 20 – 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf.

Cool soup slightly, purée, add salt.

Stack about 6 kale leaves on top of another. Starting along a long edge, roll the stack tightly, like a cigar, then cut the roll into very fine ribbons, about ⅛” thick. Repeat with the remaining kale. Toss the ribbons with a little olive oil and spread them on a baking sheet covered with a lightly oiled piece of parchment paper. Salt lightly and roast in oven until crisp, about 10 minutes.

Brown the remaining sausage in a sauté pan. Sprinkle sausage at the bottom of each bowl and add kale on top of soup.

Serve 6 – 8.
