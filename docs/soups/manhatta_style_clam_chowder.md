Add clam juice, thyme, oregano, crushed tomatoes, and potatoes. Season with red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and let simmer, covered, until potatoes are tender, 15 minutes. Add extra clam juice or seafood stock if necessary for consistency.

Add bacon, clams, and cream to pot. Simmer uncovered. After 5 minutes, add a dash of sherry and marsala to taste. Simmer uncovered for 5 more minutes. Garnish with parsley.

Serves 4.

### Notes
<ul>
	<li>If using raw clams, steam the clams in a couple inches of water and reserve water to use as clam juice</li>
	<li>If serving in a bread bowl, add stock since bread bowl soaks up lots of liquid</li>
</ul>
