	<li>⅓ c. all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>4 c. low-salt chicken broth</li>
	<li>3 c. half and half</li>
	<li>4 c. shredded cooked chicken</li>
	<li>1 tbs. chili powder</li>
	<li>1 tbs. hot pepper sauce</li>
	<li>1 tbs. ground cumin</li>
	<li>2 tsp. salt</li>
	<li>½ tsp. white pepper</li>
</ul>

### Toppings

	<li>1 c. sour cream</li>
	<li>Chopped cilantro</li>
	<li>Tomatillo or green chili salsa</li>

## Instructions
Let beans sit overnight in a large pot of cold water, covered by at least 3” of water.

Char chilies over gas flame or in broiler until blackened on all sides. Enclose in a paper bag. Let stand for 10 min. Peel, seed, and chop chilies. Set aside.

Drain beans and return to pot. Add enough water to cover beans by 3”. Simmer until beans are almost tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Drain.

Melt butter in clean, heavy large pot over medium heat. Add onions, sautéing until tender (15 min.). Add flour and stir for 5 minutes, but do not brown.

Gradually whisk in chicken broth and half and half. Simmer gently until thickened, about 10 minutes. Add reserved white beans and roasted chilies, shredded chicken, and next 5 ingredients. Simmer gently to blend flavors (20 minutes).

Serve with toppings. Serves 10 – 12.
