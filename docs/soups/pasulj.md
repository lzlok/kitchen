## Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1½ c. dried beans (Roma/cranberry/borlotti or pinto), soaked overnight</li>
	<li>1 bay leaf</li>
	<li>3 large cloves garlic</li>
	<li>3 carrots, sliced in rings</li>
	<li>¾ c. purréed tomatoes or 2 tbs. tomato paste</li>
	<li>Smoked ham hocks or smoked sausage (beef kielbasa is good)</li>
	<li>Water (depends how thick or thin you want the soup to be; from 3 cups to 5 cups water)</li>
	<li>10 black peppercorns</li>
	<li>Salt </li>
	<li>Spicy pepper (like jalapeno, etc), optional</li>
</ul>

## Instructions
Drain and rinse the soaked beans. Rinse the ham hocks before using. 

Put all ingredients in a pot (except salt). Heat to boiling then lower heat to simmer. Check after 45 minutes or so to adjust water, if necessary. Cook until beans are tender and ham hocks are soft, about 1½  – 3 hours (maybe 20-30 minutes cooking time for a pressure cooker). Adjust for salt and pepper.

Makes 4-5 servings.
